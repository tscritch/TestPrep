Some people believe that only actions that have been made _______ are immoral. |illegal|Some people believe that it is the job of the government to legislate against immoral behavior. After all, governments criminalize activities such as murder, theft and kidnapping. However, laws are made by politicians who may have an agenda which may not always be morally correct. Laws vary from place to place, whereas key moral principles are universal. For example, the extermination of the Jews by Hitler was not illegal yet virtually everyone will agree that it is immoral.
The duty to help others in need is called the duty of beneficence, whereas the duty to not harm others is called the duty of ______________. |nonmaleficence|
Some moral philosophers, such as WD Ross, believe that there are certain basic moral principles which are ____________, and he called them our prima facie duties. |self evident|Ross and some other philosophers believe that these principles do not require proof and are just so. These are duties, so can be broken should conflict arise.
The prima facie duties can be overridden, for example, where the duty to ____ would outweigh the probable consequences of keeping a promise. |help|An example best illustrates this answer. Jill has borrowed a bottle of aspirin from John and promised to return it to him today, but she has been told by John’s friends that he plans to commit suicide by overdosing on aspirin today. Her duty to help or not harm him outweighs her duty to keep her promise to return the aspirin to him.
The difficulty with the prima facie duties is that it may not be self-evident to those who are ______________ immature or those who have not thought about it sufficiently, and some people may believe that they should not have these duties at all.|intellectually|Some individuals may lack the necessary mental faculties to grasp the concept of self-evident moral principles.
Medical professionals must balance the benefits and harms before making a healthcare ____________. |intervention|Before medically intervening, the healthcare professional must determine if the benefits of the intervention outweigh the possible harms. For example, some drugs have serious side effects.
The doctrine of double ______ can be illustrated in a health care setting in a patient that is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer; the treatment has some harmful side effects but the benefits of potentially eradicating the cancer outweigh the risks of the treatment. |effect|This is the term coined for this kind of scenario where harm is deliberately induced to cause good. This doctrine is usually attributed to Aquinas and is highly controversial, especially among Utilitarians.
Most moral people would agree that where we can intervene in minimizing or preventing harm, we should do this where there is little or no risk to ourselves, even if it is not in our _____________, as we would expect others to do the same for us if we were in danger. |self-interest|We should help someone in danger where there is little or no risk to ourselves. Applying the Golden Rule, we would expect others to act that way if we were in a bad position.
The philosopher _____________, in his work The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, listed 4 principles to determine the legitimacy of government intervention in individual freedom, and these are the Harm Principle, the Offense Principle, Paternalism, and Legal Moralism. |Joel Feinberg|Paternalism is defined as having a person or the government do what they think is best for you, even if it goes against your wishes. The Paternalism Principle states that the government is morally justified in intervening to prevent an individual from harming himself severely, even if no one else is harmed. Feinberg accepts soft paternalism where those who are incompetent, for example the mentally ill or children, should be protected from hurting themselves. However, he rejects hard paternalism where even competent adults would have their liberty restricted to prevent them from harming themselves.
Feinberg expanded on the Harm Principle as laid down by _______ in that he included the obligation to act in order to prevent serious harm to others where the agent bore only a minor risk or cost to himself.|mill|Mill was the original proponent of the Harm Principle.
Feinberg’s Offence Principle permitted governments to prohibit conduct that seriously offended others, and Legal Moralism allowed for the prohibition of _______ behavior, even if no one is harmed or offended. |immoral|This is one of the principles propounded by Feinberg. He gives the example of a community attempting to hold on to their traditional ways of life by banning homosexual private acts. It is arguable that this reason is not sufficient to justify government intervention as moral pluralism is the natural course of a growing community.
____________ morality would suggest that the special parent-child relationship imposes a strong moral duty on the parents to raise, feed, educate and care for the child by virtue of an implied contract. |Common sense|There is a presumption of an implied contract in this situation even though the child is not competent to make a contract. It is similar to a citizen-state contract. If the parent fails to act in the best interests of the child, for example by abusing the child, then the State should intervene and the child no longer owes the parent a duty of obedience.
Some philosophers would argue that we have a duty of _______ concern to individuals close to us, such as family and friends. |special|Being humans, we succumb to our feelings of emotion and love for our friends and family members. Every human life should have equal value but if faced with the choice of saving the life of our child or that of a stranger, we would definitely save that of our child.
When dealing with ________, professionals such as educators, judges and doctors would normally act in accordance with the best interests principle. |children|Most courts around the world make decisions relating to children based on this principle. The UN Convention on Human Rights also states this as a fundamental principle within its charter.
From the perspective of the medical profession, the 4 main guiding ethical principles derived from common morality are beneficence, ______________, justice, and autonomy. |nonmaleficence|These are the widely accepted principles in the US that guide the actions of medical professionals.
The principle of nonmaleficence requires that we not deliberately create unnecessary harm or injury to the patient, either through acts committed or _______. |omitted|This principle applies both to acts done and those which are not done. So, the principle would be breached by a medical professional forgetting (omitting) to give a patient the correct drug at the correct time.
In order for patients in a medical environment to give their ________ consent, medical professionals must have clearly and truthfully explained all of the relevant information to them. |informed|Patients and their family members expect that medical professionals honor their moral and ethical duties to inform them completely about their situation. The veracity of the information will empower the patient to make an informed decision. 
Health and _____ professionals owe their patients and clients a duty of confidentiality regarding their information and situation. |legal|This ethical requirement is paramount in our dealings with these professionals and is clearly laid out in the ethical guidelines of the professional bodies of health and legal workers.
The principle of _______ within a biomedical context refers to equal treatment of equal persons and fair allocation of resources. |justice|Medical resources must be equally distributed between equal patients and not only, for example, to patients who are from a particular social class.
Business Ethics describes the development of responsible practices within the culture of a company in matters like corporate governance, accurate __________ and audits, fair labor practices and environmental management. |accounting|
Fair _____ practices are essential to ensure that workers are provided with a safe and humane working environment and compensated with a fair wage.|labor|Companies are ethically responsible for the health and safety of their workers. They should provide a safe environment – for example, adequate lighting and correct equipment for the workers to carry out their jobs.
When using natural resources, companies have a responsibility to balance their need to generate profits with _____________ degeneration and sustainability. |environmental|Some environmental laws are in place in several states to protect Nature, but just because there isn’t a law against it does not make it morally right. Companies should ascertain the quantity of natural resources that they can safely use while maintaining environmental sustainability, thereby allowing the resource to naturally replenish itself. Alternatively, companies can replace the resource taken. For example, to reduce deforestation, logging companies typically plant new trees to replace the ones cut down.
Many business and political leaders oppose environmental ______________ for economic reasons. |sustainability|Business and political leaders argue that the cost of environmental sustainability includes lost jobs, a lower standard of living and much higher costs to do business.
Environmentalists believe that environmental ______________ is important to the welfare of future people. |sustainability|Many environmentalists contend that unless we change our behavior, civilization will break down in a few generations.
In hiring employees, companies should have clear-cut hiring policies that prohibit any form of unfair ______________. |discrimination|This is both a legal and moral duty. Companies cannot and should not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion, etc.
The senders of unsolicited _____ messages could be considered as breaching our moral and ethical right to privacy. |email|As individuals, we have not consented to the receipt of these messages from unknown persons or companies and hence have the right to be left alone.
The US Patriot Act, enacted in 2001, was designed to considerably increase the surveillance and investigative powers of local law enforcement agencies, but it has been argued that since it was hastily introduced, it lacks the normal checks and balances that safeguard _______________. |civil liberties|The Patriot Act has been criticized for providing excessive powers to law enforcement agencies to interfere in the privacy rights of individuals.
It could be argued that the Californian law whereby criminals would automatically be sentenced to a 25 year to life sentence if they are convicted of a crime three times is an example of cruel justice because it applies to any crime, even shoplifting, so that three convictions for shoplifting would result in an extremely long prison sentence that is ________________ to the nature of the crime. |disproportionate|Sentences for crimes should be proportionate to the nature of the offence and justice should be seen as satisfying the principle of fairness. Therefore, for example, crimes that are nonviolent in nature tend to attract lower sentences than violent ones.
Lawyers normally have a strict duty of confidentiality to clients but this duty can be breached where the lawyer believes that the information revealed will __________ or prevent considerable injury. |save lives|This ethical ruling is laid down by the American Bar Association and their ethics panel used the example of an imaginary lawyer who is informed that a client has accidentally discharged toxic waste into the water supply of a town. The lawyer alerts authorities to avoid a health crisis.
Lawyers have a _________ obligation to put their client’s interests first over all other considerations. |fiduciary|A fiduciary obligation arises out of trust and confidence.
A crime can be defined as a violation of the State; where a law has been broken, blame must be attributed in a contest between the State and offender and the punishment meted out to achieve ___________ justice. |retributive|By its nature, retributive justice implies that the offender must ‘pay’ for his crime and that the punishment fit the crime. Hence, a more severe crime deserves a more severe punishment.
The intended outcome of retributive justice is the restoration of society’s moral balance through punishment, the __________ of further illegal behavior, and the protection of the community. |deterrence|Retributive justice aims to prevent further criminal activity of the offender and to deter others from committing similar illegal acts.
The opposite of retributive justice is restorative justice, where the violation is seen as against the person rather than the State and solutions are sought between the offender, victim, and community in an attempt to encourage _______ and reconciliation. |healing|This is the definition of restorative justice and this type of justice is gaining momentum in the US because it moves beyond punishment and deals with the healing and reconciliation that is necessary following a crime.
____________ justice relates to the fair division of a particular limited resource relative to demand. |Distributive|Resources must be divided fairly within communities and this is what distributive justice refers to in dividing resources relative to demand.
One of the most important arguments against reducing economic inequality by economic ______________ is that it violates the rights of those whose property is taken. |redistribution|In the Robin Hood style of taxation, a government may tax the rich in order to give to the poor. This is a form of economic redistribution.
The US governments’ duties in relation to their ethical obligations to citizens are laid out in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, ___________________ Act of 1988 and 1996, and the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. |OGE Reauthorization|These are the pieces of legislation that determine the ethical guidelines of government action.
The ethical behavior of public employees is guided by Executive Orders issued by the President. The two core concepts regulating the behavior of public employees are that they should not use their position for private ____ and that they must act impartially and not favor any person or private organization.|gain|It is morally wrong to take advantage of your position within the government to receive personal gain. For example, accepting a bribe for awarding a contract to a particular group.  
The FOIA Act of 1966 lays down the rules for persons to obtain records of federal government agencies, thereby creating a degree of ____________ in government operations as well as allowing individuals access to information held about themselves by these agencies and granting them with the power to insist that the records be corrected if in error. |transparency|In particular, FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) allows people to access records about themselves and individuals can insist that the records be changed if incorrect. This is very important in protecting the privacy rights of individuals.
In 1999, the Board of Enron decided to waive the company’s Code Of Ethics in order to hide huge amounts of debt in off-balance sheet deals, thereby breaking their duty of ____ to their employees, investors, partners, and the markets as well as raising questions about the lack of checks and balances to ensure ethical behavior by companies. |care|As the leaders of a company, the Board members at Enron owed a duty of care to all those who would be affected by their actions. It is arguable that they were negligent in their duties.
The dramatic downfall of companies like Enron was precipitated by unethical financial reporting by their accountants and this led to the enactment of the Sarbanes-_____ Act in 2002, thereby removing the previous practice of self-regulation. |Oxley|Many professionals belong to and are represented by their own organizations. They usually champion self-regulation, creating internal rules of ethical and professional conduct. The downfall of Enron led to fears that the accounting profession and capital markets could not be trusted. Hence, the US government intervened via legislation to restore confidence.
Where research studies are conducted on the general population, then distributive justice must be practiced to ensure that no segment of the __________ is excluded. |population|Where a group is excluded, for example, women, then the findings will be tainted. In the past, pharmaceutical trials were mainly conducted on male subjects and as a consequence, some medications were later found to be unsuitable for the female physiology.
Some people have argued that it is ethically questionable for the US to spend excessive amounts of money-- hundreds of billions of dollars--on the military because that money could be more ____________ used in civilian orientated programs. |productively|These people believe that spending on the military is natural and inevitable but that this amount is excessive. There is also concern about the futility of war and the lack of benefits that result from waging it. Spending the money more productively on saving lives and nurturing humans – programs such as health care, sanitation, school building, housing, etc. are considered a more fruitful, as opposed to destructive, approach.
China introduced a one child policy to control their spiraling population growth, but many Americans would probably object to the state laying down such rules on the grounds that it is _____________ and breaches the human rights of the people. |paternalistic|This intervention can be viewed as paternalistic in that the state steps in like a father figure to make rules and control the actions of his ‘children’. This can be considered hard paternalism and must be weighed against the cost to society of increased population growth, where resources would be inadequate to meet the needs of more than 1 child per family.
Many experts believe that ________ development is one way to control population. |economic|Recent studies indicate a relationship between income and family size--as income increases, family size falls. Some experts believe that by raising the standard of living among the poor,  population growth will be reduced.
Recently, the pharmaceutical giant Glaxo drastically cut the prices of drugs that treat HIV because of moral pressure from individuals who claim that the drugs are too expensive for the many HIV victims in ______. |Africa|Glaxo was accused of ignoring the majority of sufferers of this disease and putting profits before saving lives. As these HIV victims were poor, they had to die because they could not afford treatment. 
There has been considerable ethical debate about the introduction of research ‘sweat shops’ by pharmaceutical companies in Third World countries to create new drugs more quickly. Despite the rationale that this policy would save more lives, questions are asked as to whether the research subjects have the power of ________ to refuse treatment as they are in a desperate plight and may not be completely aware of what is being done to them.|autonomy|The principle of autonomy in bioethics relates to the freedom of the subjects to either accept or refuse the proposed treatment.
The case of Roe v Wade (1973) acknowledges the constitutional right of privacy and gives a woman the nonabsolute right to ________. |abortion|The Constitution does not explicitly use the word “privacy” but the Supreme Court has inferred this right from various parts of the Bill of Rights and common law.
The pro-lifers in the abortion debate argue that abortion is morally wrong because it kills a human being, but they make an ethical exception to preserve the ______'s life. |mother|Where the life of the mother is in danger, then an abortion is ethically justified.
The most liberal view on abortion is that a woman’s right to choose whether to have an abortion can be exercised at ________ during the pregnancy. |any time|This view is based on the belief that the fetus is not a person and hence does not have the right to life.
The ________ voices on abortion argue that it is morally acceptable depending on the developmental stage of the fetus. |moderate|Most moderates disagree on where the line should be drawn on an acceptable time frame to allow abortions. Most do agree that it is acceptable in the first trimester of the pregnancy and unacceptable in the final trimester unless the mother’s health is threatened.
Infertility clinics create embryos in ___________ treatments, but many that are created are discarded when not used and moral controversy has erupted because some people believe that embryos have the right to life. |infertility|In the IVF process, eggs are fertilized with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos before implantation in the woman’s womb. Some people believe that embryos have the right to life because fertilization has already taken place.
The use of public funds to cover the cost of abortions for poor women can be ethically supported on the grounds that prohibition of such funding would deny women the _____ right to abortion on the grounds of their financial status and be a breach of the principle of justice. |legal|Under the principle of justice, there should be equal treatment of equals. So, if only affluent women could afford abortions, then equality would not be achieved.
With regards to suicide, the 3 viewpoints are that it is always wrong, it is always right and that it _______. |depends|Some philosophers argue that the circumstances must be considered before making a moral judgment.
It can be argued that being autonomous individuals, we should be able to choose how we live or die but some philosophers believe that this right is not absolute and that we must consider the ____________ of our actions. |consequences|This is because suicide may cause unjustified harm to those left behind; for example, families and friends.
If we witness an individual trying to commit suicide, most of us would probably try to dissuade him from going through with it but we probably have no right to permanently dissuade him as this would interfere with his rights to autonomy unless he is ___________. |incompetent|If an individual is not yet an adult or if we suspect that he is of unsound mind, then these individuals should be protected from themselves, and morally, intervention would be justifiable.
Autonomy is the ability to make one’s own _________. |decisions|The principle of respect for autonomy implies that one should be free from coercion in deciding to act, and that others are obligated to respect privacy, tell the truth and protect confidentiality.
Some people believe that suicide is never morally acceptable and most of these people base their objections on _________ grounds. |religious|Jews and Christians often turn to ‘Thou shall not murder’ as the reason God prohibits suicide, implying that suicide is self-murder. However, other theorists do not agree with this as suicide is not expressly prohibited in the Bible.
__________ is a thorny moral issue and can be defined as the act of killing or allowing the death of an individual who is hopelessly ill for reasons of mercy. |Euthanasia|It is conducted in the interests of the person undergoing euthanasia--to end their suffering and preserve their dignity or autonomy. 
___________ euthanasia occurs when an individual undergoes euthanasia without having freely given their consent and must be immoral as it ignores the wishes of the individual and hence violates their human rights. |Involuntary|This is the definition of this kind of euthanasia and would not only be morally wrong but also illegal and considered an act of murder.
Voluntary _______ euthanasia is permitted in the US because a competent individual is entitled to refuse medical treatment and it could be argued that this act is morally acceptable because it respects one’s right to autonomy as well as appeals to virtues such as kindness and compassion. |passive|Voluntary passive euthanasia occurs when a person refuses medical treatment that could save their life. Therefore, a person’s right to autonomy is respected.
Voluntary ______ euthanasia refers to the direct action that causes death, such as a person asking a doctor to inject him with a lethal dose of drugs. Many people would consider this immoral because it can never be permissible to kill a person. |active|This is effectively what is being asked of the doctor by this person. When compared with passive voluntary euthanasia, it seems that it is more acceptable to let someone die rather than to actually kill that person.
It can be argued that letting a person die is as _______ as actually killing a person, especially if the outcome of the former causes more suffering. |immoral|When withholding treatment, the person may suffer more pain for a longer time. Compare this with the swift end of the lethal injection.
Fears have been expressed that if active euthanasia is socially acceptable or legalized, then moral __________ will set in as respect for life is reduced and this may lead to abuses. |corruption|The fear here is that if active euthanasia is acceptable, then it may open the floodgates for the acceptability of killing the disabled or elderly. Opponents of this view say the risk is exaggerated.
Where the patient is ___________--for example, in a persistent vegetative state--decisions about withholding or providing medical treatment must be made by others in consultation with health staff, but extreme caution must be taken in these circumstances. |incompetent|In this position, one person is making life and death decisions on behalf of another and this is fraught with moral difficulties. Some believe that nonvoluntary passive euthanasia can be justified for the patient’s dignity, autonomy, and to minimize suffering. However, there must be strong grounds to show that the patient is suffering terribly, is extremely unlikely to recover, and has lost higher mental functioning capabilities.
Some believe that in matters of taxation, everyone should pay a flat rate regardless of income whereas others believe that it is fairer and more ethically justifiable to have a graduated system based on individuals’ ______. |income|People are not equal when it comes to paying taxes because their earnings are different. Therefore, it is argued and adopted by many governments that those who earn more money should pay a higher tax rate.
Some people believe that Black Americans do not receive equality in society due to racial discrimination,  and so support policies called __________________. |affirmative action|These policies (begun in the 1960s) cover a wide range of actions and give minority applicants priority over whites for jobs, promotions and college admissions.  This is highly controversial.
Affirmative action covers a wide variety of policies and programs. One form of affirmative action is ____________ treatment. |preferential|Preferential treatment is a controversial policy which promotes selecting less or equally qualified minority applicants over white applicants for employment or school admissions on the basis of race. 
Many people have questioned the preferential treatment of blacks over whites and argue that it is a form of reverse discrimination, and hence, a denial of _______ for whites. |justice|They argue that if it is ethically wrong to discriminate against blacks on the basis of their race, then surely it is just as wrong to do the same against whites.
Proponents of preferential treatment morally justify the policy on the grounds that black Americans have suffered undue harm from past racial discrimination which has resulted in the current absence of equality of ___________ and equal treatment, and hence this policy is necessary to correct this imbalance. |opportunity|It is argued that past discrimination led to inferior education, housing, health care, jobs, etc., and hence black Americans were not offered the same prospects for progress as whites were.
Some philosophers have argued that the ethical dilemma with preferential treatment is that in __________ one group, you end up harming another. |benefiting|By denying a more highly qualified white person a job, these persons may be denied a position in the nation’s elite society grouping. In making up for past discriminations, the whites who suffer now had no hand in participating in previous inequalities, whereas those who did are not made to bear the burden.
The right to bear arms is enshrined in the American psyche but some people question the ethical justification for the storage of firearms in the home where a _____ may be able to obtain it and cause injury to himself or others. |child|In 1997, the US Center for Disease Control and Protection released a report that revealed that the US had the highest rate of childhood homicide, suicide, and gun related deaths.  Many people would argue that guns are needed for protection. Opponents of gun ownership however, argue that unless guns are well locked away, children may be able to access them. They further argue that if guns are well locked away, then they would not offer much protection since they could not be easily accessed. This is a case of balancing harms - the need for a gun with the potential harm it could cause a child.
Incarceration is a typical form of punishment levied on perpetrators of crime, but moral concerns have been raised over imprisoning _________ and those with intellectual disabilities. |juveniles|There is concern that the incarceration of juveniles will prepare them for a life of crime rather than reform them, as they can be trained by other more experienced criminals in the prison.
Capital punishment of persons who commit crimes under the age of 18 is permitted in some US states; this is morally questionable because a person under 18 is not considered fully _________. |competent|Some contend that children under 18 lack maturity and rationality to be able to fully comprehend their actions and their consequences. Thus, many argue that it is not ethical to execute someone who committed a crime, albeit a serious one, when still a juvenile. It is argued that rehabilitation would be the kinder and more compassionate course of action.
There are many proponents of capital punishment and they morally justify their stand on the grounds that it is an effective _________, is less costly to taxpayers than life imprisonment, provides emotional relief to the loved ones of the victim, and is permissible by God in the Bible. |deterrent|Many believe that this is a justifiable reason for capital punishment, in that it provides closure for the loved ones and hence is morally right.
The opponents of capital punishment contend that ____________ is adequate. They argue that capital punishment is immoral on the basis that it is an ineffective deterrent, it perpetuates and makes violence acceptable, it is applied discriminatorily, and offenders may change into good people, but perhaps the most compelling reason is that the offender may be innocent. |imprisonment|Mistakes in the criminal justice system are inevitable--no system is perfect. Therefore, many argue that it is unethical to execute someone where they may be innocent. Executions cannot be reversed.
The two main ethical issues that arise when dealing with war are: 1) when is it acceptable to resort to war and 2) what are the moral ______ in waging it. |limits|States cannot wage war when they feel like it. There must be reasons and conditions for waging war.
_________ believe that war is never justified, arguing that it is not only immoral, but ineffective. |Pacifists|Pacifists cite two reasons for believing that war is never justified; first, that war is immoral (regardless of goals) and second, that war is ineffective (violence always results in more violence).
Pacifists contend that war violate a person’s moral right to ____ and this cannot be justified by any good that may result from the war. |life|This is one of the consequences of war--soldiers as well as innocent civilians are killed.
Just because one is a pacifist does not mean that one does not fight for one’s beliefs; instead, the struggle is of a __________ nature. |nonviolent|This is the way pacifists believe that we should deal with our problems – passive resistance. Well known pacifists include Mohandas K Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
The use of __________, chemical, and nuclear weapons in war against our enemies would be considered by many to be immoral because these weapons could potentially harm many innocent civilians and we have a duty to minimize harm we cause to them. |biological|It is impossible for governments to make an undertaking not to harm any civilians at all. Unfortunately, wars cause harm to civilians as well. However, governments have a duty to minimize as far as possible the risk of harm to civilians; for example, by not bombing residential areas.
The policy of deterrence involves threatening to _________ and inflict unacceptable damage on an adversary in order to discourage attack. |retaliate|To support the deterrence strategy, large stockpiles of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons were maintained by the US during the Cold War. The policy of deterrence, where a state threatens to launch nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against another state in the event of an attack by the latter, can be considered ethical because if successful, then many lives are saved, and if it's unsuccessful, then the former state may still choose not to retaliate in that way.
In the US, the Constitution states that only Congress can declare war, yet President George W Bush authorized an attack on Afghanistan without a Congressional declaration of war and so the question arises as to whether Presidents can ethically ______ the spirit of the Constitution in this way and personally possess the authority to wage war. |bypass|The Constitution contains this provision in order to maintain a system of checks and balances in the government as well as to ensure the legitimacy of the proposed war action. No one person alone should have the authority to declare war.
The just war tradition states that it is acceptable to go to war to protect innocent persons from harm and to protect a state or its people from unfair __________. |aggression|
Pacifists believe that war is always ineffective and never justified, even when __________. |legitimate|Pacifism is based on the theory that peaceful relations, rather than confrontational ones or violence, should be the governing force surrounding all human interrelations. Pacifism dictates that disputes should be resolved through negotiation, surrender, or resettlement.
Before establishing war, the Law to War, or _____________, should be consulted to determine whether entering into war is justifiable. |Jus Ad Bellum|Medieval philosophers believed that these rules must be followed if the war was to be a just one. These required that the war have a just cause, be declared by a sovereign state with legitimate authority, have the intention of ultimately restoring a just peace, be in proportion to the harm suffered, have a reasonable chance of success and be used only as a last resort. It does not say anything about the length of the war; in other words, it does not have to be a short war for it to be a just war.
In war, the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is fundamental and the just war theory states that it is acceptable to attack combatants in a just cause and not only is it unacceptable to attack _____________ but strong steps must be taken to avoid harming them. |noncombatants|Noncombatants are the innocent victims who are not involved in the fighting – women, children, etc.
It is widely accepted that wars to conquer another land are _______ unacceptable. |morally|Nations are entitled to territorial integrity and political independence.
Some philosophers believe that where an invasion or military attack has occurred, countries have an immediate right to retaliate and defend themselves, but in the absence of such an event, military action is only justifiable where authorization has been obtained from an _____________ body. |international|These thinkers believe that bodies such as the United Nations or NATO have the authority to approve such actions and that the issues will be carefully analyzed by them so that the chances of an unjust war are reduced.
Preemption refers to military action that is taken first in self-defense and may be morally justifiable where there is strong evidence that an attack is ________ and that waiting could make self-defense more uncertain and complicated. |imminent|This is the definition of preemption. Making moral judgments on preemption are extremely difficult and would depend on the circumstances of each case.
Most people would agree that a war initiated to remove an oppressive government would be ethically acceptable to protect human ______ and ensure justice. |rights|Oppressive governments breach many ethical principles and their removal would be justified.
Military intervention by one state in another may be justifiable to protect alliances or to prevent very serious breaches of ____________, but these measures must be taken very carefully so that war is not overused as a means of solving problems. |human rights|The security of a state can in some measure be attributable to the alliances it has made with other states. So, by protecting these alliances, they are also bolstering their own self-defense systems.
The term ‘__________ damage’ refers to noncombatants who have been killed as a consequence of an attack on a justifiable military target and is a sensitive ethical issue. |collateral|
Many people believe that collateral damage is morally __________ to win the war, shorten it, or to save their own soldiers' lives. |acceptable|If the war can be shortened by an attack that will destroy an important military installation but at the same time kill many noncombatants, then these people believe that collateral damage is acceptable.
Some philosophers believe that actions in our self-interest have moral limits, and hence, attacks at military sites which will cause noncombatant casualties must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be essential to winning or shortening the war. Steps must be taken to minimize harm to noncombatants and where excessive numbers of noncombatant lives are endangered, then the action should be _______, even if it will mean losing the war.|avoided|Where the cost in innocent human lives is too high, the moral justification for collateral damage is overridden.
Some people contend that we need to change the way we treat the environment today to create a ___________ society, as we have ethical responsibilities to the future generations of the citizens of the world. |sustainable|Our treatment of the environment today could impact the health and well-being of the people born in the future. Time is not a relevant factor here – we owe not only present people a duty of care but also those in the future.
There are many opponents to environmental sustainability and many challenge the existence of environmental problems such as ______________ on the grounds that such moves will lead to economic loss. |global warming|These people argue that environmental sustainability is morally unacceptable as people may lose their jobs, prices and taxes may rise, etc.
On matters of environmental sustainability, both harms and benefits will result and _________ the two will be difficult, but many environmentalists view this as essential for the long-term future of the Earth. |balancing|This is a great ethical responsibility – balancing harms and benefits. It is important that an overall, long-term perspective be maintained when making these decisions.
According to Leopold, a __________ reflects a conviction of individual responsibility for the health of the land. |land ethic|Environmentalist Aldo Leopold believed that land owners were the biggest obstacle to conservation efforts on private land. He thought that individual ethics (land ethic) were needed to motivate land owners and that economic incentives and legal restrictions were ineffective.
Environmental degradation is an inevitable consequence of _________________ and should be distributed fairly, but studies in the US have shown that the burdens are mainly borne by the poor, minority communities. |industrialization|Various studies from the 1970s, 80s and 90s have shown that toxic waste grounds are primarily located in minority neighborhoods. This is because rich, middle class white people object to having such waste products in their areas and have enough clout to have their objections adhered to.

Each twin has her own major organs but Jill’s cardio-vascular system does not function and she relies on Jane for oxygen and nutrients. It is accepted medical opinion that Jane would die within six months if Jill were not removed. If Jane died, then Jill would die too. If Jill were removed, then Jane would very likely survive and lead a normal life. However, removing Jill would mean certain death for her. The doctors believe the best course of action is to remove Jill so that Jane can survive. Grace and Tim are devout Catholics and refuse to sacrifice Jill because their religion prohibits it. Grace’s parents believe that the separation should proceed even though Jill will die because it is the best course of action given the circumstances. In the absence of the parents consent, the hospital makes an application to court seeking permission to carry out the separation despite the parents’ objections.

In allowing the separation to go ahead, the court has actually sanctioned _________________. |active euthanasia|Active euthanasia occurs when someone deliberately kills a patient. In this case, Jill was deliberately killed as a result of the separation. Active euthanasia is normally considered morally indefensible. However, this case scenario is exceptional because one child had to die to save the other. The alternative of both dying would have been considerably less desirable.
Grace Gordon and her husband Tim are overjoyed when they discover that Grace is pregnant with twins. They are not financially well off, so they choose not to see a gynecologist or obstetrician throughout the pregnancy. When Grace goes into labor, she checks herself into Mount Elizabeth Hospital. The doctors perform a routine ultrasound scan on Grace when she is admitted. They are amazed to discover that Grace is carrying conjoined twins. An emergency caesarean section operation is performed and the twins are delivered safely. Grace and Tim name the twins Jill and Jane. The girls are conjoined at the pelvis. Each twin has her own major organs but Jill’s cardio-vascular system does not function and she relies on Jane for oxygen and nutrients. It is accepted medical opinion that Jane would die within six months if Jill were not removed. If Jane died, then Jill would die too. If Jill were removed, then Jane would very likely survive and lead a normal life. However, removing Jill would mean certain death for her. The doctors believe the best course of action is to remove Jill so that Jane can survive. Grace and Tim are devout Catholics and refuse to sacrifice Jill because their religion prohibits it. Grace’s parents believe that the separation should proceed even though Jill will die because it is the best course of action given the circumstances. In the absence of the parents consent, the hospital makes an application to court seeking permission to carry out the separation despite the parents’ objections. The court grants the hospital's application. The separation is performed; Jill dies but Jane survives and leads the normal life of any other child. If no separation had occurred and both girls were left alone, then both would have died in about six months. Jane’s death would then arguably be a case of _______ euthanasia. |passive|Passive euthanasia occurs when medical treatment is intentionally withheld, thereby resulting in the eventual death of the patient. Again, this case is unusual because not doing anything would have resulted in the death of both children and doing something would have resulted in active euthanasia for Jill.

Prima facie obligations are not absolute. The actual obligation is the duty you have and this is determined after weighing up the prima facie obligations.

Therefore, in this exceptional case, Jill’s rights could be breached to save Jane’s life. Keeping Jill attached to Jane would kill Jane. Jill would have died within 6 months anyway. So, it is better to save one life rather than to let two children die.

Therefore, the consent is best obtained from the relevant adults.
Scenario 4 Glaxoff Pharmaceuticals is a multi-national corporation that sells medical drugs. They make billions of dollars in profit every year. As part of their “Giving Back to the Community” project, they start dispensing free tuberculosis medication to the impoverished people of Harikiri in Africa. Sam and Simon, aged 16, both receive this medication weekly when they queue up at the local community centre. Lately, both of them have become unwell. Volunteer doctors from an international charity run tests on the teenagers and discover that they had ingested an unidentified chemical. Over the next month, about 30% of the Harikiri population falls ill from the same chemical, which the doctors dubbed Agent X. The doctors launch an investigation and soon discover that the tuberculosis drugs are laced with Agent X. Glaxoff admits that Agent X is a new experimental tuberculosis drug that has not yet received Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval. They justify their actions on the grounds that all Harikiri residents signed a contract agreeing to become test subjects for Agent X at the start of their free treatment. The doctors point out that the agreement is in English and the Harikiri residents speak French and so were unable to read the agreement. They signed it out of desperation to receive what they thought was the standard course of treatment for tuberculosis. They had no idea of the risks involved in being test subjects for an experimental drug and no one from Glaxoff explained this to them. If the executives at Glaxoff Pharmaceuticals were in the original position as detailed in _____'s theory, then the scenario described would not have occurred. |Rawls|John Rawls believed that people in the original position do not know their societal position--whether they are educated or not, whether they are rich or poor. Therefore, these people would make contracts that are fair and just.

This is a basic human right. We have the right to choose whether we wish to undergo certain medical procedures or not. By producing the contracts in a language the locals did not understand and by failing to explain to them what was going on, Glaxoff breached their right to patient autonomy.

Scenario 5 Jelisa Jones is pregnant and the fetus is 8 weeks old. She is 17 years old. The pregnancy is the consequence of a rape. The perpetrator of the rape has not been captured despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies. Jelisa is an honor roll student at the Ronald Reagan High School. She recently won a scholarship to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University in England. She is also a gifted pianist and has performed at several state-wide events. She is devastated by the rape but is undergoing counseling and has sought to put the horrendous event behind her. However, the pregnancy has reignited the nightmare of the rape and has affected her mental and physical recovery. Jelisa’s rape counselor, Marion Webster, talked to Jelisa and gave her the option of continuing with the pregnancy or having an abortion. Jelisa is torn. On the one hand, she desperately wants to have the abortion because she fears she cannot care for a baby fathered by a rapist and will lose her chance to go to Oxford. However, Jelisa can defer her entry into Oxford, have the baby but then give it up for adoption. Jelisa’s mother is staunchly anti-abortion and believes the fetus has a right to life. Jelisa’s father believes that Jelisa should have an abortion because she is too young to put her life on hold and to have a baby. elisa’s intelligence and accomplished piano playing are virtues that can be considered _______ and acquired qualities, respectively. |natural|Natural qualities include intelligence and strength and are inherent in a human being. Acquired skills are attained through practice and the ability to play the piano well can only be achieved through practice.

In the US, the right to abortion is enshrined in the seminal case of ___ v. Wade. |Roe|Roe v. Wade gave women the right to choose what happens to their bodies when the Supreme Court extended the right of privacy to include abortion. However, this right is not absolute. So, for example, a woman in her 8th month of pregnancy would not normally be allowed an abortion unless it is necessary to save the woman’s life.

If abortion were made illegal, it would go underground and be less safe for women. The social costs of enforcing a law against abortion would also be undesirable.

However, if the fetus is not considered a person, then the rightness and wrongness of abortion would be simpler.
Scenario 6 Hermione Harris is a successful banker. She is a Vice-President at the National Jersey Bank. She is married to Jeremy Johnson, a Public Prosecutor. They are in their late 30s and have just discovered that Hermione is pregnant. Both are overjoyed. They intend to continue working full-time and plan to hire a nanny for their baby after it is born. At the 20 week ultrasound scan, doctors inform Hermione and Jeremy that the baby has Down syndrome. This condition is caused by a chromosomal abnormality. A child with Down syndrome will have a distinct physical appearance, which may include a short neck, small head, slanting eyes and flat nasal bridge. In addition, the child may have normal or limited mental abilities and the level of retardation may be mild or severe. Some children with Down syndrome grow up to be healthy adults with jobs but others will need assistance to perform daily activities. Hermione and Jeremy are horrified by this news. They reason that their busy careers will not allow them to take care of a retarded child. In addition, their disposable income will reduce as a consequence of caring for such a child. They refuse counseling and immediately opt for an abortion. They discover that abortions in their state are only permitted up to 16 weeks of pregnancy unless the mother’s life is in danger. Undeterred, Hermione and Jeremy discover that the neighboring state of Swanton has more relaxed abortion laws which permit termination up to 22 weeks. They travel to a hospital in Swanton and abort the fetus. If Hermione and Jeremy believed they made a moral decision and placed their well-being above that of their fetus, this indicates that they are ethical _______. |egoists|They are ethical egoists because they believe that it is morally correct to do what they believe is in their own self-interest.

They wanted to continue enjoying a high standard of living and the cost of caring for a disabled child would have reduced their disposable income.
Scenario 7 Penelope Perrier is 45 years old. She is married and has a 16 year old son. She is estranged from her husband and they have not lived together for 10 years. He lives in Canada but Penelope has lost touch with him and does not have his contact details. Penelope spills a kettle full of boiling water on her legs. She suffers first degree burns and is admitted to Mercy General Hospital. She is treated and discharged after three days in hospital. At a follow-up appointment 10 days later, she is told that her legs are infected and her right big toe is gangrenous. The doctor recommends amputation of the gangrenous toe and warns Penelope that if the infection does not improve, her legs may also become gangrenous. The toe is amputated but the infection in the legs does not improve despite antibiotic medication. Penelope tells the doctor that she wants her legs “saved at all costs”. She also tells her son that “I would rather die than have my legs amputated”. Penelope goes into septic shock and collapses into a coma. It is accepted medical opinion that Penelope would die if her legs are not amputated. The doctors insist that the legs be amputated because it is in her best interests. Her son believes that his mother would rather die than have the amputation. The husband cannot be found.  The approach taken by the doctors can be described as __________________  because the doctors are effectively overriding Penelope’s autonomous choice. |Strong paternalism|Strong paternalism refers to overriding the autonomous decision of a person to protect them from self-harm.

She suffers first degree burns and is admitted to Mercy General Hospital. She is treated and discharged after three days in hospital. At a follow-up appointment 10 days later, she is told that her legs are infected and her right big toe is gangrenous. The doctor recommends amputation of the gangrenous toe and warns Penelope that if the infection does not improve, her legs may also become gangrenous. The toe is amputated but the infection in the legs does not improve despite antibiotic medication. Penelope tells the doctor that she wants her legs “saved at all costs”. She also tells her son that “I would rather die than have my legs amputated”. Penelope goes into septic shock and collapses into a coma. It is accepted medical opinion that Penelope would die if her legs are not amputated. The doctors insist that the legs be amputated because it is in her best interests. Her son believes that his mother would rather die than have the amputation. The husband cannot be found.  If one of the doctors believes that it is right that Penelope’s wishes should be followed when the other doctors believe that amputation is right because this is in her best interests, then the theory that allows for both parties to be right is called ethical __________. |relativism|Ethical relativism allows for rightness or wrongness to vary from person to person or society to society.

Scenario 8 Marsha Brady is a 35 year old mother of three children aged 10, 7 and 4. She is happily married to Matthew. Marsha gets into a car accident with a drunk driver, Aaron. Aaron escapes unscathed but Marsha suffers multiple, serious injuries including a fractured right femur, ruptured spleen, collapsed lung and cracked skull. She is rushed to hospital where doctors fight hard to save her life in surgery. Marsha survives the surgery but falls into a coma. She appears to be in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) and is on a respirator. PVS is an almost irreversible condition where all higher-level mental capabilities such as emotion, thought and awareness, are absent. Marsha has not made a living will. Two years pass as Marsha’s family tirelessly try to help her regain consciousness. Marsha’s body begins to show signs of neurological damage and she starts having violent spasms several times a day. Matthew now realizes that Marsha is merely a shell and will never recover. He accepts that she is no longer sentient. Marsha is fed through a naso-gastric tube. Matthew wants the hospital to remove the respirator and naso-gastric tube and allow Marsha to die naturally. Marsha’s parents believe that the removal of the naso-gastric tube is tantamount to starving their daughter to death. They are against this and insist that such a death is not natural at all. They still believe that Marsha may miraculously wake up one day. Marsha's parents' contention that the removal of the naso-gastric tube is tantamount to starving her is arguably a form of ethics of ____ because they adopt the compassionate approach. |care|The ethics of care is a feminist theory where the approach to ethics is based on relationships. So, it is possible they would approve the removal of the respirator but insist that nourishment be delivered through the naso-gastric tube until Marsha dies naturally.

The doctors in Switzerland ascertain that Dr Rice is acting on his own free will and that he is not being coerced. They give him a cocktail of drugs. Dr Rice returns to his hotel room with a nurse. He says his goodbyes to his family members and then takes the drugs in their presence. Within a few minutes, Dr Rice passes away peacefully.  Dr Rice admires Aristotelian ethics and is satisfied that his actions are __________ because he has thought through his intended actions and is carrying them out to die with dignity and spare his family the pain of watching him die a painful death.|courageous|Aristotle disapproved of suicide to escape poverty, love or anything painful. He said that these acts were not courageous, but implied that suicide with other more virtuous motives might be.

Scenario 1 Fred Flare is a 25 year old marine biologist. He works on Fraser Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The Great Barrier Reef is the greatest marine reef in the world. One morning, Fred is collecting samples from sea fans in the reef. He is so engrossed in his work that he does not notice a box jelly fish swim towards him. The box jellyfish is one of the most lethal creatures on Earth. People who are stung by the box jellyfish suffer intense pain and many die within 3 minutes. Death is usually caused by respiratory paralysis, neuromuscular paralysis drowning, and cardiovascular collapse. Fred feels the painful stinging caused by the box jellyfish and manages to pull himself into his boat. His colleagues radio for help and rush him to shore where a waiting air ambulance flew him to the hospital. There is no anti-venom for box jellyfish stings. Amazingly, Fred survives the incident. Considering the number of stings he suffered, this is highly unusual. His medical team runs a battery of tests and they credit his survival to a rare antibody. This antibody, identified as XR90, was previously not known to exist. It is estimated to occur in only 0.003% of the population. Fred soon recovers and returns to his job. Two years later, Fred reads a newspaper article that heralds the discovery of anti-venom for box jellyfish stings. A single dose costs $150. Fred later finds out that his blood and plasma samples taken by the medical team were used to engineer the anti-venom. Fred was not told that his bodily samples were being used for medical research. He has contacted the medical team and pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug and accused them of breaching his privacy. This scenario is a good example of how utility can conflict with personal ______ for the greater good of society. |rights|Fred was not asked whether his samples could be used. If he had said no, then no anti-venom may have been developed. So, he was not asked and his samples were used. Arguably, the breach of his rights are overshadowed by the greater good produced by creating the anti-venom.

Scenario 11 William and Wilma West have been married for 30 years. They are both in their 60's and own a small home. Last year, Wilma was diagnosed with a progressive fatal condition that causes constant pain. Wilma’s medical team estimate her life expectancy at 3 years. Wilma does not have medical insurance and so all of their savings have been used to pay medical bills. They have tried to secure public assistance but because they own their own home they are unable to get welfare. So, they need to become homeless to qualify. Selling their home would be difficult now because William spends all of his time caring for Wilma. Unfortunately, Wilma is slowly losing her battle with life. She is rapidly losing the ability to speak or move and is now confined to a wheelchair. William has to do everything for her, including giving her morphine to numb the intense pain she is enduring. Wilma tells William that she can no longer bear the unrelenting pain. She wants William to help her die. William is torn and fearful of criminal sanctions that may be imposed as a result of his actions. Assisting suicide is illegal where they live. William and Wilma discuss the situation and after much soul-searching, William decides that it is in his wife’s best interests to end her life as quickly and painlessly as possible. With Wilma’s blessing, he places a pillow gently over her face and presses down. Within a few minutes, Wilma is dead. William intends to lie to the doctor and coroner. He will tell them that she died naturally and hope they will not conduct an autopsy. The failure of the welfare system to allocate any financial assistance to William and Wilma can be deemed as a failure of ____________ justice. |distributive|Distributive justice refers to the distribution of burdens and benefits in society.

Scenario 12 The United Kingdom has a National Health Service (NHS) which offers free health care to all of its residents. The cost is met through government spending which is raised through taxation of residents. Cheryl and Charlie Charter have just had their first child at Frampton General Hospital. Their daughter Christa was born prematurely at 26 weeks. She weighed only 1.2 lbs at birth. Christa has serious lung, brain, kidney and heart problems because she was born so prematurely. She needs a constant supply of oxygen and has been fed through a tube because she cannot suck from a bottle. A year later, Christa is still an in-patient at the hospital. She has never been discharged from the hospital. She is severely disabled and needs constant medical care in order to survive. Her parents want Christa to receive artificial ventilation in a life-threatening situation. The hospital believes that extraordinary life-sustaining treatment would not be in Christa’s best interests because the quality of life she has is extremely poor. The medical community is concerned that the care Christa is receiving diminishes the quality of care another baby could receive because the NHS has finite resources and a limited number of hospital beds. They sympathize with the Charter family but believe that the course of action they propose is best for both Christa and the NHS. Cheryl and Charlie justify their request for Christa to receive extraordinary life-sustaining treatment on the basis that utility should be measured according to their ___________. |preferences|Charlie and Cheryl are preference-utilitarians. This means that utility is measure by their personal preferences.

They sympathize with the Charter family but believe that the course of action they propose is best for both Christa and the NHS. A Kantian would ________ (agree or disagree?) with Cheryl and Charlie’s request for Christa to be placed on extraordinary life-sustaining treatment. |disagree|You could not consistently will this as a universal law because it would ultimately mean that the NHS may no longer be able to function because their resources would run out. This would lead to unhappiness for all.
The United Kingdom has a National Health Service (NHS) which offers free health care to all of its residents. The cost is met through government spending which is raised through taxation of residents. Cheryl and Charlie Charter have just had their first child at Frampton General Hospital. Their daughter Christa was born prematurely at 26 weeks. She weighed only 1.2 lbs at birth. Christa has serious lung, brain, kidney and heart problems because she was born so prematurely. She needs a constant supply of oxygen and has been fed through a tube because she cannot suck from a bottle. A year later, Christa is still an in-patient at the hospital. She has never been discharged from the hospital. She is severely disabled and needs constant medical care in order to survive. Her parents want Christa to receive artificial ventilation in a life-threatening situation.

However, if they really did love her, they would not be so selfish as to deny her natural death when her quality of life is so very low. It also indicates weakness because they cannot bear to part with her. Obviously, this is a very difficult situation for the parents and doctors.

So, these must be assessed to ensure that no one else is unnecessarily denied or deprived of appropriate treatment.
Scenario 13 Shortly after midnight on 3rd December 1984, poisonous gases leaked from a factory in Bhopal, India. This factory was owned by the Union Carbide Corporation (UCC). The leak occurred because the safety systems in the factory failed. There was no warning. The poisonous gases seeped through the town and Bhopal residents woke up at night struggling for breath, the gas burning their eyes, noses and mouths. Approximately 20,000 people died from the exposure. A further 120,000 still suffer illnesses as a result of their exposure. These include blindness, breathing difficulties and gynecological problems. In the aftermath of the leak, UCC attempted to push the blame on to others and even refused to divulge the composition of the chemicals that leaked. As a consequence, the treatment provided to the victims was less effective. The Indian government came to a settlement with Union Carbide in 1989 which resulted in a compensation of merely $2200 for families of the dead. Union Carbide did not clean up the site of the disaster. A 2004 study found soil and water around the factory contaminated with organochlorines and heavy metals. In 1991, the local government in Bhopal charged Warren Anderson, the CEO of Union Carbide at the time of the leak, with manslaughter. He has evaded an international arrest warrant. Greenpeace found him living in a luxurious home in the Hamptons in 2002 but neither the US nor Indian governments seem interested in extraditing him to India. Union Carbide was also charged with culpable homicide in India but has refused to attend court. By evading the arrest warrant, Warren Anderson displays the vice of _________. |cowardice|He does not want to face the court that has charged him with manslaughter. This is cowardly behavior because he is not facing the consequences of his actions.

This demonstrates a lack of ________ and justice. |equality|The Bhopal victims were mostly poor, uneducated people. They were unable to stand up for their rights because they didn't know how to nor did they necessarily know what their rights were. They did not understand the nature of their illnesses or the fact that it would be ongoing for many years. So, they were taken advantage of and given a sum of money to silence their protests.

That has not happened in Bhopal.
Scenario 14 George Greer was a criminal and gang member. He murdered a grocery store owner and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, fifteen years ago. The police captured him shortly after the crime. He was tried, found guilty and sentenced to death by electrocution. He has been in Georgetown State Penitentiary since his conviction for this murder. About ten years ago, George realized that he was a bad person and vowed to change his life. He found comfort in religion, read books and became a model prisoner. He even started a program in prison to reform gang members. It has been a great success. Three out of four gang members who undergo the program do not re-offend. George has become a highly respected figure both in the prison and in mainstream society. He is portrayed as a savior to all those afflicted by gang violence. George has been on death row for 15 years but his time has now run out. He is scheduled for electrocution in 3 days. Many of George’s friends, family and supporters want the death sentence commuted to life imprisonment because George is a changed man. They argue that he works for social justice and order. He is no longer a menace to society. He made a mistake and two people paid the ultimate price but his death will not turn back the clock and bring them back. However, Mr. and Mrs. Lee’s children insist that the electrocution be carried out because they believe in an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Appeals to the Governor fail and George is executed.  If the society George lives in developed their laws based on Rawls’s original position, then that society is ________ (likely or unlikely?) to have capital punishment. |unlikely|According to Rawls, rational persons in the original position are likely to choose principles that are the least bad given a set of alternatives; i.e. the maximin principle. Therefore, capital punishment is unlikely to be a law because the people in the original position do not know if they are a criminal or law-abiding citizen. They are more likely to choose long prison sentences for perpetrators of serious crimes.

Retributive justice refers to a form of criminal justice which is justified on the basis that the wrongdoer has created an imbalance in the social order which must be corrected by a punishment against the wrongdoer. The punishment should be proportional to the crime committed. So, in this case, they are asking for George’s life because he took their parents' lives.

Rule utilitarians will conclude that more well-being would be produced from the rule permitting the execution of all murderers accused of first-degree murder when compared to other alternatives.

If we assume that George’s society has a long-held belief that capital punishment is acceptable, then when considering the moral correctness of capital punishment, we should not _______ accept it merely because it is acceptable in that society. |blindly|Cultural relativism does not mean that morality is set in stone. Beliefs can change over time and just because it is acceptable at one point in time does not make it morally right. For example, if a community believes that child slavery is acceptable, that does not mean it is morally right.
Scenario 15 Larry and Leona Star are happily married with two young children, Chip and Charlene. Larry’s job at Steer Inc. means he regularly flies to Columbia on business trips. Last month, Larry was kidnapped by a rebel group who demanded a high ransom of $1 million for his release. Steer offered to pay the ransom. The ransom drop-off was arranged with the rebels who promised to release Larry when they received the money. Twelve hours after the ransom drop-off, there was still no sign of Larry. Attempts to contact the rebel group were futile. Leona was devastated when her husband did not appear. After a year of waiting, Leona held a funeral for her husband. Everyone presumed he was dead. Three years later, Leona is with a new partner, Hank. They live happily together in Leona’s house with Chip and Charlene. Out of the blue, two police officers come to their house one morning. They tell Leona that Larry is alive. He managed to escape his captors but got lost in the jungle. He fell down and hit his head causing him to lose his memory. He has been living with some villagers in Columbia. He regained his memory last week and went straight to the US embassy. Larry wants to reunite with his family. Chip and Charlene are overjoyed to hear the news but Leona is torn between Hank and Larry. According to the Divine Command Theory, Leona has committed the sin of ________. |adultery|Adultery is considered a sin in all the major religions.

First, Leona’s obligation as a wife to Larry. However, she thought Larry was dead, so she formed a relationship with Hank. She now has an obligation to him. There is also another obligation to her children and what would be best for them. Kant’s theory is absolute, so there is no real solution in situations of conflict.
Scenario 16 Guantanamo Bay in Cuba is used by the US government as a prison to incarcerate alleged terrorists. These alleged terrorists, which the US government has dubbed “enemy combatants”, have not been charged with any crime and have been detained since the camp opened in 2002. The US government insists that international law allows them to detain “enemy combatants” - who do not enjoy the rights of prisoners of war or US citizens accused of crimes – without charge or trial for the length of the war. Therefore, the detainees do not know when they will be released. They have been denied access to lawyers. The US government has acknowledged that detainees on hunger strike have been force-fed through a tube pushed into their noses. The United Nations in a report published in 2006 called for the closure of the camp and release or trial for the 500 inmates. The report claims that US treatment of the detainees violates their rights to physical and mental health. In addition, they assert that force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike is tantamount to torture. The US government responded by claiming that it is not breaching any human rights. They assert that they are currently engaged in a “war against terror” and Guantanamo Bay is a deterrent that prevents further attacks on the US. According to the Divine Command Theory, you should love your neighbor and if they hurt you then you should turn your cheek; therefore, war can only be explained under this tradition if Aquinas’s theory of ____ war is adopted. |just|According to Aquinas, a just war is one that is declared by a competent authority, has a just cause and is fought with the right intentions. There are other requirements, such as minimizing the loss of human life and there must be a reasonable chance of success.

It is plainly offensive and indefensible.
Scenario 17 Samantha and Sarah have been best friends since they were 3 years old. They are neighbors and attend the same school, have the same friends and enjoy the same hobbies. In their senior year in High School, they both got their drivers licenses and were each given a new car by their wealthy parents. One day, they were both invited to a party at Dan’s house and were very excited because Dan promised it would be the social event of the year. Since they were both going to the party, Samantha offered to drive Sarah to the party in her car and promised to bring her home. The party was already in full swing when they arrived at 8 p.m. Dan’s parents, who ran a business together, were away in New York on a business trip. There were no adults present at the party. There was plenty of beer and wine at the party which had been purchased illegally by Dan because he is a minor. Many of Samantha and Sarah’s friends from school were drinking the alcohol and getting drunk. Not wanting to appear out of place, both Samantha and Sarah started drinking beer too even though they had never done so before. After a few hours, both girls were rather drunk and felt it was time to go home. They staggered out to the car. Jonathan, a friend from school, tried to prevent Samantha from getting into the car and driving because he could see that she was drunk. The car keys fell to the ground and Sarah picked them up. She realized that neither of them was capable of driving and asked Jonathan if he could drive them back. Jonathan obliged and they got home safely. Jonathan was not under any obligation when he prevented Samantha from driving home drunk. If we apply the principle of __________________ it becomes clear that Jonathan helped because he would expect someone to do the same for him if he was in that situation. |universalizability|This principle requires consistency in conduct. So, if Jonathan asked himself if it would be morally acceptable for someone to just let him drive away drunk, he would probably say no. Therefore, he had to stop Samantha from drunk driving.

Dan’s parents believe that consumption of alcohol by minors, even though it could be considered a ‘harmless’ offense, can be legitimately criminalized in accordance with the balancing test laid down by ________. |Feinberg|Feinberg weighs the seriousness of the offense, repugnance, and inconvenience, as well as other factors, to determine if the activity should be criminalized.
Samantha and Sarah have been best friends since they were 3 years old. They are neighbors and attend the same school, have the same friends and enjoy the same hobbies. In their senior year in High School, they both got their drivers licenses and were each given a new car by their wealthy parents. One day, they were both invited to a party at Dan’s house and were very excited because Dan promised it would be the social event of the year. Since they were both going to the party, Samantha offered to drive Sarah to the party in her car and promised to bring her home. The party was already in full swing when they arrived at 8 p.m. Dan’s parents, who ran a business together, were away in New York on a business trip. There were no adults present at the party. There was plenty of beer and wine at the party which had been purchased illegally by Dan because he is a minor. Many of Samantha and Sarah’s friends from school were drinking the alcohol and getting drunk. Not wanting to appear out of place, both Samantha and Sarah started drinking beer too even though they had never done so before. After a few hours, both girls were rather drunk and felt it was time to go home. They staggered out to the car. Jonathan, a friend from school, tried to prevent Samantha from getting into the car and driving because he could see that she was drunk. The car keys fell to the ground and Sarah picked them up. She realized that neither of them was capable of driving and asked Jonathan if he could drive them back. Jonathan obliged and they got home safely. Drunk-driving is a criminal offence and therefore it limits a person’s autonomy because it prohibits drunken people from driving. This autonomy-limiting law is generally accepted because it satisfies the ____ principle. |harm|The harm principle (JS Mill) allows a limitation on a person’s autonomy if he/she may hurt others through his/her actions.
Scenario 18  In 2006, Google launched its services in China through their local partner. The content Google provides in China is in the Chinese language. The law in China requires technology firms operating in China to censor politically sensitive information. For example, references to the Tiananmen Square massacre and famous dissidents must be blocked. The Chinese government keeps a very tight rein on the Internet and what content users can access. Some political commentators are disappointed with Google’s decision to comply with the Chinese government’s censorship requirements arguing that they were putting profit before principles. China has a booming economy and is a massive market because their population exceeds 1.3 billion. Google defended their actions by pointing out they were only complying with the local laws. If Google did not comply with the local laws, then they would not have been permitted to operate in China. They claim they can play a more useful role within the system than by boycotting it, despite the compromises that needed to be made. The censorship laws enforced by the Chinese government are a restriction on ___________, a principle many consider to be a basic human right.|free speech|Many philosophers, especially those in the West, consider free speech to be a basic human right.

Scenario 19 Animal dissection is practiced in many classrooms around the world. Animals such as frogs and mice are bred and then killed by animal supply companies. These dead animals are then stored in biological warehouses before being shipped to schools. Animal supply companies are not charitable organizations. They are businesses and therefore make a profit in killing and then selling these animals for dissection. Maria Fernandez is a high school student at Carter High School. She objects to animal dissection, arguing that it is cruel and inhumane. In addition, Maria contends that dissection does not encourage respect for other living creatures. She points out that some studies have shown a correlation between how students treat animals and how they treat one another. Therefore, she believes that if students are taught to devalue the life of animals, then they are more likely to devalue each other. Maria believes that she can learn as much through computer model simulations. Many teachers are sensitive to such objections but point out that simulations are not as good a learning tool as real dissections. One of the teachers, Mrs. Delton, points out that the lives of animals aren’t really important and that only human lives count. Maria has started a petition to offer alternatives to students who do not wish to practice dissection. Maria believes that animals have equal worth as human beings and the term which describes bias for the interests of one species against the interests of another is __________. |speciesism| Speciesism is a term coined by Peter Singer. He believes that equality should apply to animals as well as to humans.

Scenario 20 Nick and Nora Norris are a happily married couple in their 40s. Nick runs a home for orphans and Nora is a teacher. In order to pay for their children’s college tuition, they sold their home and moved into Nick’s parents’ house. Nick’s parents, Tina and Tim, are in their 70s. They are in good health but are aware that they are approaching their twilight years. They are happy to have their son and his wife living with them for company and support. A year later, Tina and Tim decide to gift their home to Nick and Nora on condition that they can continue to live in the home for the rest of their lives. The rationale for doing this is to avoid probate problems when Tina and Tim die. Another year passes happily, and then Tim has a stroke. He recovers but is confined to a wheelchair because his left side is paralyzed. Nick and Nora now have to help Tina care for Tim. They are happy to do this at first but then realize that it is a time-consuming and thankless task which interferes with their lifestyle. Nick and Nora decide that they need to reclaim their lives. They kick Tina and Tim out of the home and demand that they move out to a care home for the elderly at their own expense. Tina and Tim are shocked and dejected and refuse to move out. Nick and Nora call the police. Nick and Nora obviously possess some virtuous characteristics because Nick runs an orphanage and Nora is a teacher, but the Greek philosophers realized that one can possess virtuous characteristics and yet be _______ in other conduct. |immoral|The key here is that individuals can appear to be moral because their actions appear to be moral, but their motivations reveal something else or their actions in other aspects of their life reveal immoral activity.

 Scenario 21 Oliver and Olivia have been married for 5 years. They are in their mid 30s and have been trying to conceive for 4 years. Both Oliver and Olivia are corporate lawyers in high-flying stressful jobs. Their cumulative annual income exceeds $500,000. Recently, they consulted a fertility expert, Dr Lynn Lamb, at Mount Sinai Hospital. She ran some tests and concluded that their fertility problems were due to Oliver’s low sperm count. She suggested in-vitrofertilization (IVF) treatment. Oliver and Olivia agreed. Olivia’s eggs and Oliver’s sperm was harvested. Then, under laboratory conditions, eight of Olivia’s eggs were fertilized with Oliver’s sperm. Six of these fertilized eggs were placed in Olivia’s womb. The remaining fertilized eggs were destroyed. Olivia became pregnant. The ultrasound scan showed that five of the six eggs had implanted in her uterus and were forming into fetuses. Doctors advised Olivia to abort two or three of the fetuses to give the remaining fetuses a better chance of survival. Having quintuplets carries a very high risk to both the fetuses and the mother; the mother may suffer illnesses such as preeclampsia and diabetes. The fetuses will be born prematurely and may be afflicted with heart and lung problems, blindness and cerebral palsy and therefore are less likely to survive. Olivia and Oliver are torn about what to do. If Olivia and Oliver took the position that the destruction of the fertilized eggs was a part of the process of infertility treatments and were necessary to assist childless couples with having children, then they would be adopting a ___________ approach. |utilitarian|The destruction of the eggs was necessary to increase the overall well-being of childless couples by helping them conceive.

 Scenario 22 Rita Rice is a 30 year old Vice-President in an international bank. She is greatly admired by her colleagues who believe her to be a hard-working, intelligent, capable and dedicated employee. Her rise in the bank has been meteoric as she has been promoted three times since she joined the bank five years ago. Rita got married last year and is now three months pregnant. She informed her superiors of her pregnancy and her intention to take three months maternity leave. A month later, Rita was given a new project. The project she had been working on, a high profile financial transaction involving $10 billion, was passed on to her colleague Victor Vase. Rita’s new project is less important and worth only $10 million. Rita was bemused. She was brushed-off when she asked why she was given a new lower profile project. Nonetheless, Rita persevered and carried out her duties efficiently. Three months later, when Rita was seven months pregnant, her superiors called her to a special meeting. At this meeting, they alleged that Rita was not pulling her weight at the bank. They said that she was taking too much time off to go to the gynecologist and that she was not a dedicated employee. Then they fired her. Rita’s dismissal is arguably a case of _____________________.|sexual discrimination|It appears that the bank fired Rita because she was pregnant and had unwarranted concerns that she was unable to do her job as well as she did previously.

Scenario 24 Betty Bonner is a personal assistant to the Senior Vice-President of Sales at City Financial Brokers (CFB), an insurance broking firm. As brokers, CFB promise customers to survey the market and then select the plan that is best for their clients--the best coverage from insurers at the best price. Last week, Betty overheard her boss in a meeting with other executives. They were gloating over the huge bonuses and kick-backs they had received from Spartan Insurance. In fact, they were planning how to celebrate their windfall with the purchases of new cars and expensive holidays to exotic destinations abroad. They discussed how their arrangement with Spartan to aggressively promote and sell their policies led to a win-win situation for both organizations. This internal policy of steering business to a particular company resulted in a bumper amount of contingent commissions paid to CFB by Spartan. Betty was very concerned by what she heard. It did not seem to her as though CFB was acting in the best interests of their clients. To the best of her knowledge, CFB did not disclose any contingent commission arrangement to their clients. After mulling on it for a few days, she contacted a local attorney and the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers with the information she overheard. Betty’s action in informing on a sharp practice in her workplace primarily reveals the virtue of _______. |courage|It is courageous because Betty stands to lose a lot by her whistle-blowing actions. She may lose her job if the company is found guilty of breaking the rules. She also may lose the friendships of colleagues as well as their trust.

Last week, Betty overheard her boss in a meeting with other executives. They were gloating over the huge bonuses and kick-backs they had received from Spartan Insurance. In fact, they were planning how to celebrate their windfall with the purchases of new cars and expensive holidays to exotic destinations abroad. They discussed how their arrangement with Spartan to aggressively promote and sell their policies led to a win-win situation for both organizations. This internal policy of steering business to a particular company resulted in a bumper amount of contingent commissions paid to CFB by Spartan. Betty was very concerned by what she heard. It did not seem to her as though CFB was acting in the best interests of their clients. To the best of her knowledge, CFB did not disclose any contingent commission arrangement to their clients. After mulling on it for a few days, she contacted a local attorney and the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers with the information she overheard. The workers at CFB took advantage of their clients because they believed that they were superior and could exploit their clients trust, obedience and humility--qualities which Nietzsche labeled the _____ morality. |slave|Nietzsche believed superior people could dominate and exploit the weak and so he called the qualities possessed by the weak slave morality.
Scenario 25 Will Wong is a 28 year old administrative manager at Goons Inc. He is a third-generation Chinese-American. Will was hired by Goons two years ago. His latest job review states that his performance has been very satisfactory. He has just been awarded with a modest pay rise. Last night, the company Christmas party was held at a local restaurant. All the employees were present and plenty of food and beer was laid on for the staff. As the evening progressed, the employees relaxed and had fun. Will was chatting with several fellow employees. Henry, a computer support specialist said, “I hope those yellow-skinned slit-eyes from China won’t take all our jobs because they are so cheap!” Then, Reece, Will’s boss said, “At least they can’t speak decent English. We have to keep them at arms length or they’ll ruin the American way of life.” Will was deeply offended but said nothing. Fran, an administrative manager in a different department who was hired last year, mentioned how happy she was with her 10% pay rise. She thought in college that she would never earn in excess of $60,000 per year until she was in her 40s but now that she had done it before she hit 30, she was thrilled. Will was stunned. He had received a 5% pay rise and his salary was now only $55,000 per year. The next day, he had a quiet word with Fran who said her starting salary was $60,000 and that with the recent pay rise, her salary had jumped to $66,000. Will does not understand why he is on a lower salary when he does the same job and has put in more years at Goons than Fran. Will believes that Goons Inc. practices ______ discrimination because he is paid a lower salary than his colleagues in the same job. |racial|Racial discrimination occurs when someone is treated less fairly on the basis of their skin color or national origin. Reece, Will’s boss, made a statement at the party that indicated his bias.

Scenario 26 In 1994, the United Nations (UN) and the United States (US) received information that the Hutu majority in Rwanda planned to exterminate the minority Tutsis. They did not act on it. In merely 100 days, the Hutus murdered approximately 800,000 Tutsis in an unforgettable bloodbath. Even as the corpses piled up, the UN and US continued to avoid calling it genocide. The lack of action by the US, UN and other world leaders has been blamed on the death of 18 U.S Rangers during a peace-keeping mission in Somalia. There was fear of getting involved in another dangerous African situation. As a result of the world turning its back on Rwanda, a repeat of the events similar to those that occurred in Nazi Germany were perpetrated once again. As the Tutsis fled in horror, the UN withdrew their forces and other countries airlifted their nationals to safety. The killers did not discriminate, every single man, woman and child who was Tutsi were exterminated with the goal to eliminate an entire race of peopleIf the UN, US and other world leaders had intervened, then many hundreds of thousands of lives would probably have been saved.  The reasons given by the US, UN and other world leaders for failing to act are based on a ___________ calculation. |utilitarian|They attempted to balance the benefits and burdens of interfering. As 18 Rangers had recently died in a peace-keeping mission, the US, UN and other world leaders made a calculation that they would rather save the lives of their own nationals rather than risk their nationals’ lives in Rwanda.

It is arguable that the UN, US and other world leaders had a ____ to protect the Tutsis. |duty|It is arguable that sovereign nations should not interfere in the business of other countries. However, if there is evidence of serious abuses of human rights, then a country should not just stand by and permit the extermination of an entire race. There is arguably a duty to minimize suffering, and to resist an evil and protect the weak where they are unable to protect themselves. Most people would probably agree that it would have been morally just if humanitarian intervention in Rwanda had taken place.

In addition, it would fail the respect for people formulation of the categorical imperative because the indigenous people do not wish to have foreigners in their country telling them what to do.
