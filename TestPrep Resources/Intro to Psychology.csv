The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is made up of two parts, the ___________ division and the parasympathetic division.|sympathetic|The two divisions of the ANS commonly work in opposition to each other. That means the sympathetic becomes active when a person is in a state of emotional excitement, and the parasympathetic is activated when the body is relaxed and quiet.
________ Skin Response (GSR) is used to measure of a subject’s level of anxiety.|Galvanic|Galvanic Skin Response is the change in the electrical resistance of the skin.  The skin's ability to conduct electricity increases as the moisture on it increases; even tiny changes in sweat output, undetectable by sight or touch can be measured by testing the skin's conductivity.

The second major function of the spinal cord is its involvement in the spinal ________.|reflexes|These are very simple automatic behaviors that occur without the conscious, voluntary actions of the brain.
The most important of our endocrine glands is the _________ gland.|pituitary|The pituitary gland is often referred to as the master gland, reflecting the fact that it directly controls the activity of many other glands in the system. The pituitary is nestled just under the brain.  Another reason this gland is so important is the massive amounts and varieties of hormones that it secretes.

Signal detection theory takes the position that stimulus detection involves a decision-making process of separating a signal from __________ noise.|background|This occurs when one needs to judge whether or not a stimulus has been presented. That judgment is made in the context of a shifting background noise created by other stimuli in the environment and by one’s own nervous system activity.
______ came up with the Hierarchy of Needs.  Needs towards the bottom of the hierarchy must be fulfilled before needs towards the top become a motivator.|Maslow|Abraham Maslow is known for his hierarchy of needs.  At the bottom are the basic physiological needs, such as food and water.

_________ is the sense of taste.|Gustation|There are four basic sensations of taste: sweet, salt, sour and bitter. All the other flavors are odors produced as food is crushed by the teeth.
The __________ system is designed to detect the position and motion (or acceleration) of the head in space. As a sensory system we are hardly aware of it.|vestibular|It does not enter consciousness as does vision, audition (hearing), somesthesis (touch), olfaction (smell) and taste. Even though we are not usually aware of the sensations produced by the vestibular apparatus, the normal functioning of it is essential for motor coordination, eye movements and posture.
Maximum perceptual development takes place between the ages of three and a half and _____ years of age.|seven|A child perceives differently from an adult, and although utilizing the same sense of sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, they possess different approaches to processing the information.
General Adaptation Syndrome consists of a series of reactions a person’s body progresses through in response to stress.  There are three stages: _____ reaction, resistance, and finally exhaustion.|alarm|Exhaustion is the final stage of General Adaptation Syndrome.  Exhaustion occurs if the first two stages fail to reduce the stress.

Schemas are organized mental representations of the _____.|world|Schemas assist children, and others, to categorize information and develop subgroups for linking past knowledge with that learned in the future for the process of distinction.
_____________ involves changing and revising existing schemas in the face of new experiences or new information.|Accommodation|Piaget proposed that children assimilate new ideas into existing schemas and modify or accommodate the old ones by which they progress through the four identifiable stages of development.
The four stages of cognitive development include the ____________ stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operations stage, and the formal operations stage.|sensorimotor|
In the ____________ stage, children discover by sensing and by doing.|sensorimotor|This stage includes causality, by which each child gradually comes to know that some events have knowable causes and that some behaviors cause predictable reactions.
By the end of the sensorimotor experience, children have established that although ________ objects may not be present, they still exist, and will at times await their reappearance. This awareness is called object permanence.|physical|For example, before a child develops object permanence, if you hide a toy under a blanket, it will no longer exist to the child.
The ______________ stage is a time where the child’s thinking is self-centered.|preoperational|It is during this stage that the child comes to understand that he/she is an independent and separate person in the world.
In the concrete operational stage, children begin to develop many concepts and show that they can __________ those concepts. |manipulate|It is in this period that we may say that rule-governed behavior begins.  The concrete, observable objects of the child’s world can be classified, ranked, ordered, or separated into one or more categories.
Behaviorism emerged as a reaction against functionalism, and states that psychology should focus only on __________ behavior.|observable|Behaviorists focus on objective observable behavior (what the person actually does).  They reject internal events such as states of mind, feelings, etc.
Conservation involves the cognitive awareness that changing the form or the __________ of something does not necessarily change what it is.|appearance|With an ability to solve concrete observational problems, a marker is reached that signals the beginning of the concrete operational stage.  An example of this ability is demonstrated when a child understands that two different shaped containers can contain the same amount of liquid.

A major criticism of _____’s psychoanalytic perspective is that it is extremely difficult to test in the laboratory, making it a theory that no one can prove or disprove.|Freud|Freud is known for coming up with psychoanalysis, which emphasizes the existence and influence of the unconscious mind.
Chemicals that alter the consciousness of a person by inducing changes in perception, mood, and/or behavior are known as ____________ drugs.|psychoactive|They are called this because of their effect on basic psychological processes.
________ is a state of consciousness in which an individual’s attention is highly focused, and the individual is more suggestible and willingly and uncritically accepts many illogical situations.|Hypnosis|Hypnosis is defined differently by different psychologists.  However, there are three basic characteristics—highly focused attention, suggestibility and a willingness to do what the hypnotist tells him or her to do, and a willingness to accept illogical situations (i.e. petting an imaginary rabbit).

Depressants are the opposite of __________.|stimulants|They reduce one’s awareness of external stimuli, slow normal bodily functions, and decrease the level of overt behavior.
Those chemicals known as hallucinogens have the most ___________ effects on consciousness. One of the main reactions to these drugs is the formation of hallucinations, usually visual.|predictable|Users often report seeing things when there is nothing there to see, or they tend to see things in ways that others do not.
On some occasions, ___ (a hallucinogenic drug) gives rise to the experience of synesthesia.|LSD|In this condition, a stimulus of one modality is perceived in a different modality, a crossing-over of sensory processing. Fr example, the individual may hear colored lights. 
The locus of control is a personality construct referring to an individual's perception of events as determined internally by his/her own behavior vs. fate, luck, or ________ circumstances.|external|For example, someone with an external locus of control often will not accept responsibility for his failure, and instead blame it on something else.  A person with an internal locus of control is the opposite--blames everything on himself, even if it's not his fault. 
Marijuana is a consciousness-________ drug that we’ll consider as a special case because it does not fit into a special drug category very neatly.|altering|It often acts as a depressant, yet in high doses can act as a hallucinogen.

Psychology was just beginning to emerge as a science late in the nineteenth century. At this time, Ivan Pavlov was using his skills as a physiologist to try to understand the basic processes of digestion.  In his research he discovered a basic principle of conditioning known as a ______.|reflex|Pavlov is famous for his experiment in which he conditioned a dog to salivate at the sound of a bell.  Originally, the dog would salivate when it saw food.  The sound of a bell was always followed by food, and eventually, the dog would salivate when it heard the bell, whether there was food or not.
A reflex is defined as an unlearned, automatic response that occurs in the presence of ________ stimuli. |specific|These are mental and physical reactions to the environment around a person.
Pavlov’s study is now known as _________ conditioning.|classical|This is a type of learning in which an originally neutral stimulus comes to evoke a new response after having been paired with another stimulus that reflexively evokes the same response.  In Pavlov's experiment, the dog's reflex--salivating, became a conditioned response to the bell.  Salivating is an unconditioned response to food, but a conditioned response to the sound of a bell.
_____________ stimulus is a term for a stimulus that produces a response, even in the absence of conditioning.|Unconditioned|An example is the unconditional stimulus of food in the classic studies of Ivan Pavlov, which always produces the unconditional response of salivation. 
To get classical conditioning under way, a second stimulus, which is _______, must be presented, and initially produces a minimal response or a response of no particular interest.  This stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus.|neutral|This process is technically referred to as habituation.
A conditioned response is the recurring result of action that indicates a behavior is _______ or conditioned.|learned|A conditioned response is a response that normally is not associated with a stimulus.  For example, in Pavlov's experiment, a dog was conditioned to salivate every time it heard a bell ring, even if there was no food.  Normally, dog's do not salivate at the sound of a bell, so salivating was a conditioned response to the ringing sound. 
Skinner used the term _______ to refer to behavior that an organism may use to operate on its environment.|operant|Operants, or behaviors used to operate on an environment, are said to be controlled by their consequences-they will maintain or increase their rate if they are reinforced; they will decrease their rate if they are not reinforced or if they are punished. 
Aversion therapy is performed by linking behavior with _________ discomfort.|immediate|For example, applying an electric shock to a patient each time they attempt to drink alcohol.  The shocks cause the patient to develop a conditioned aversion to drinking.
_______ involves reinforcing successive approximations of the response that one ultimately wants to condition.|Shaping|

Humanistic psychologists place greater importance on an individual’s own will.
A cognitive map is a mental representation of the ________ situation or physical environment.|learning|The term cognitive map was originally coined by EC Tolman in 1948 to describe the way rats learn to map the environment of an experimental maze.  Research indicated that rats learned not just a series of turns or responses, but also a general idea of the location of the reward relative to the starting position.
Albert _______’s approach to learning is also cognitive in nature, but he added a decidedly social aspect to the process and for that reason it is often referred to as the social theory.|Bandura|The central idea of this theory is that learning takes place through the observation and the imitation of models. What makes social learning theory social is the notion that we often learn from others. 
A punisher is a stimulus that _________ the rate or probability of a response that precedes it.|decreases|
In operant conditioning, ______________ occurs when a response reinforced in the presence of one stimulus also occurs in the presence of another, similar stimulus.|generalization|Therefore, the person responds equally to both stimuli, as he/she recognizes a close relationship between the two stimuli.
An instinctive drift is the term used by the Brelands to note that some behaviors are more _________ to condition than others.|difficult|That is, in spite of conditioning efforts, an organism will drift toward doing something that comes naturally.
When it comes to suicide, the vast majority of suicide attempts are made by _____, however, suicide attempts made by men are much more likely to succeed.|women|Men have a higher suicide completion rate than women.  This is partly because the methods used by men and women differ.  Men use more violent means, like shooting or hanging, while women use drug overdoses or poison.  For men, suicide is the eighth leading cause of death and more than four times the rate in women.
A ________ reinforcer is a stimulus presented to an organism that increases the rate of a response that precedes it.|positive|Positive reinforcers are similar to rewards.  Reinforcers are stimuli that encourage the desired response.  Positive reinforcers increase the likeliness of a response by rewarding the desired response.  Negative reinforcers increase the likeliness of a response by removing something painful or undesirable once the desired response occurs.
A ________ reinforcer is a stimulus that increases the rate of response that precedes its removal.|negative|Although it seems a bit contradictory, a negative reinforcer exists to increase the rate of response to a certain stimuli.  BUT--a negative reinforcer is something that the person wants to go away.  For example, a seat belt buzzer is a negative reinforcer.  It goes away once you buckle your seat belt.  This is in contrast to a positive reinforcer, which would be rewarding you for doing the right response, instead of removing an irritation.
______ conditioning is a part of operant conditioning and demonstrates negative reinforcement.|Escape|Here, an organism learns to escape from a painful situation. If an appropriate response is made for the situation and the escape is successful, the organism is reinforced and will tend to make the same response again in the future with a similar situation.  The negative reinforcement (the painful situation) is removed upon the correct response.
Another negative reinforcement in action is _________ conditioning. Here, an organism learns to avoid unpleasant and painful situations before it occurs.|avoidance|The major difference between avoidance and escape conditioning is the addition of a cue or signal that precedes the negative reinforcer. Responding appropriately to the signal allows the organism to prevent the painful, unpleasant situation before it occurs. 
Learned helplessness is a condition in which a subject does not attempt to escape from a painful or noxious situation after learning in a ________, similar situation that escape is not possible.|previous|
_______ reinforcers are stimuli (usually biologically or physically based) that increase the rate of a response with no previous experience required.|Primary|Primary reinforcers produce comfort, end discomfort, or fill an immediate physical need.  They are natural, nonlearned, and rooted in biology.  Food, water, and sex are obvious examples.
A _________ reinforcer contains stimuli that increase the rate of a response because of their being associated with other reinforcers; also called conditioned, or learned, reinforcers.|secondary|Examples of learned or secondary reinforcers include money, praise, attention, approval, success, affection and grades.
When determining traits in a new child—i.e. hair color or eye color, each parent contributes a gene for that trait, whether it is dominant or _________.|recessive|A gene can be either dominant or recessive.  For example, blue eyes are a recessive trait.  That means both the mother and the father would have to pass the gene for blue eyes for the child to have blue eyes.  If the mother passes down brown eyes (dominant) and the father passes down blue eyes (recessive), the child will have brown eyes.
A continuous reinforcement schedule is a reinforcement schedule in which each and every response is followed by a __________.|reinforcer|One problem with the CRF schedule is that earning a reinforcer after each response may soon reduce the reinforcing nature of that reinforcer--in other words, the reinforcer eventually loses effectiveness.
Alternatives to reinforcing each and every response are called ____________ reinforcement schedules.|intermittent|These are strategies for reinforcing a desired behavior less frequently than each and every time it occurs. 
______________ is the process of differential reinforcement wherein one (positive) stimulus is reinforced while another (negative) stimulus is not.|Discrimination|This essentially occurs when only the positives are reinforced and the negatives are ignored.

Obsessions and compulsions both fall under obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
________ memory stores our life events and experiences.|Episodic|It is a time-related memory, and is very much autobiographical.  For example, a memory of your tenth birthday would be episodic--you remember it as an event or associated with a specific time.  On the other hand, remembering the meaning of 'justice' would go into semantic memory--you probably don't remember when or where you learned what that word means.
Metamemory is a long-term memory, and is responsible for storing knowledge of ___ our own memory systems work.|how|It essentially directs all long-term memory searches.
Category clustering is the recall one experiences through the process of ________ words together into categories even if they are presented in a random order.|grouping|Typically this categorization is done through conceptual processes.

An algorithm is a problem solving strategy that guarantees that you will eventually arrive at a correct ________.|solution|It involves systematically exploring and evaluating all possible solutions until the correct one is found.  For example, math problems have algorithms which allow you to find the correct answer.  For most real-life problems, however, you use strategies, not algorithms, and a strategy is just an approach to trying to find a solution to a problem.  For example, if you're unemployed, you may develop a strategy for finding a job, not an algorithm. 
_________ strategies are problem solving in nature, and allow for a hypothesis about a problem’s solutions to be generated and tested in a time-saving and systematic way, but does not guarantee an acceptable solution.|Heuristic|Typically a heuristic is a rule of thumb that reduces the number of alternatives a person must consider.
