Socialization is an extremely important part of schooling.  ________’s article on socialization and education brought to light many down-to-earth elements of teaching.  District standards and district multiple measures (tests), have altered teaching to better match what will be tested at the end of the year.  Meeting grade level goals seems to be more of a socialization goal for first graders.|Arnstine|In early grades, it’s more important for children to learn how to be social than to actually learn the technical curriculum.
It is possible to attempt a _______ between education and socialization.  Teachers feel tremendous amount of pressure to prepare their students for standardized tests.  The students in these classes are missing out on the most important educational experiences due to pressure placed on their teachers to get their students to perform well on tests.|balance|Although pressure is put on teachers to have students perform well on standardized tests, it is equally important for a focus to be placed on socialization.
Schools typically evaluate children applying to pre-kindergarten and kindergarten to determine school _________.|readiness|
Many teachers have removed projects and theme units so they can cover the material.  Teachers should feel encouraged to educate with projects and theme units.  This is where _________ really takes place.|education|Teachers commonly feel pressed for time due to crowded curricula.  Therefore activities such as theme units and group projects are often taken away, to the detriment of socialization.
______ defined four stages of cognitive development.  An important characteristic of the preoperational stage is that the child is very egocentric--he/she has difficulties seeing another person's point of view.|Piaget|The Preoperational Stage is the second stage, and lasts approximately from 2-7 years of age.  An example of egocentrism is a boy assuming that all boys share his fear of dogs, or being unable to understand that his father is too tired to play even though the boy is full of energy.
Educators must guide students to discern between the benefits and opportunities of globalization and the new information technologies on one hand, and the dangers, threats, and pitfalls on the other. We must develop in them the sense of freedom and ______________ in making the right choices.|responsibility|Along with the freedom to make choices is the responsibility to make the right choices.  This is an essential factor for socialization.
The first step in any ____ is determining the objectives.|plan|In any plan, whether it's a token economy, or some other kind of teaching plan, the first step is determining your objectives, or what you want to accomplish with the students or your classroom as a result of this plan.
Just two years after the UN proclaimed the year 2000 as the International Year of the Culture of _____, ushering a global effort of transforming our culture of violence and death into a culture of peace, we live in an Age of Terror; fear and insecurity, and we have embraced a culture of greed.|peace|In a time when terror, fear and insecurity, and an embraced culture of greed have become so prevalent, many nations and organizations such as the UN have made definite efforts to show the importance of Peace to youth, for a peaceful environment in which to grow and develop.
____________ is the principle that the amount or number of something remains the same even if the arrangement or appearance is changed--as long as nothing is added and nothing is taken away.|Conservation|Having difficulty with the concept of Conservation is a characteristic of the preoperational stage, as defined by Piaget.  For example, you take two equal balls of play-doh, and a boy agrees that both have the same amount of play-doh.  Then you flatten one of the balls so it is like a pancake, and the boy says the pancake now has more play-doh than the ball--this boy is in the preoperational stage, having difficulty with conservation.
Kerry J. _______’s paper entitled, “Building Civic Capacity for a New Century: Engaging Young People in Civic Institutions and Civil Society,” called education a key factor in change.|Kennedy|Education is a primary factor in change, as it influences the voices and the decision-makers of tomorrow.
Perspective-taking is the ability to assume another person's perspective and __________ his/her thoughts and feelings.|understand|Perspective-taking develops over time, until older adolescents and adults can even imagine how different cultural or social values would influence someone's perceptions.
He (Kennedy) says there is undoubtedly a role for the school __________ as the single most important policy instrument societies have to develop civic capacity in young people. He asks what should be the nature of the school’s mission in the new century, and how can it contribute to capacity building in future citizens.|curriculum|Since education is such a key factor in change, it is only natural that the mission of schools should be to form children with the best interests of society, and change in mind.
Employers and schools alike are beginning to recognize the importance of a School-to-____ system.|Work|School-to-work programs are being used more and more to prepare students for the work world, as opposed to preparing students who are only used to an academic atmosphere.
If in two different settings, the same people take a professional certification test twice, and they score in the same performance bracket both times, then the certification test is said to be ________.|reliable|The test is reliable, because it provides consistent results.  It doesn't matter when people take it, if they take it one week to the next--assuming their abilities have not changed--the test returns the same results.
Non-tracked, thematic programs of study should prepare all students for entry into both higher education and high-_____ employment.|skill|Different students require and aspire to different things.  With thematic programs of study they are more immersed in the fields which interest and apply to them.
A test can be reliable, but if it turns out that it doesn't really accurately test what it's supposed to, then it is said to lack ________.|validity|A test lacks validity if it does not really measure what it is supposed to measure.  For example, a professional certification test might get consistent results whenever the same people take it at different times...It's reliable.  But, if it does not accurately measure their capabilities in the work place like it was designed to do, then it's not a valid test--it lacks validity.
According to Maccoby and Jacklin, boys are more __________ than girls.|analytical|According to their research, boys have higher analytical ability involving spatial relations than girls, better at mathematical skills, mechanical processing, etc..
Many of today's high schools place students in high school education tracks. These should be replaced by programs of study organized around high academic standards, broad career themes that foster inter____________ approaches to instruction, and the integration of classroom and work-based learning.|disciplinary|Tracks can be limiting and inaccurate.  Instead of those limiting tracks, programs of study organized around high academic standards, broad career themes that foster interdisciplinary approaches to instruction, and the integration of classroom and work-based learning can be invaluable.
Selection of a ______-focused program of study in high school should be based on general interests and should not be a final, high-stakes career decision.|career|Career-focused programs can give information and experience to students that will give them a great advantage when entering the work-world.   Of course we must be sure that the programs are not too focused, to give the student a broad prospective and the ability to experience different things as well.
Students should select programs of study based on their general ____________ and career interests.|intellectual|Students should be given the freedom to make their own choices, as they will need to do throughout their lives.  Therefore, selecting courses for programs based on intellectual and career factors are an obvious opportunity to put this decision making process to work.
Rather than having to make a definitive career choice, students should opt into a broad curriculum that teaches academic and _________ skills in an engaging and hands-on way through the lens of a career or discipline that interests them.|practical|The career that interests them should not dictate every course the student takes.  Though there should be a general program focused in that direction, a broad concept should be applied in case of a change of heart or a need for more exposure to other subjects.
Work-based learning yields _______s that classroom-based education alone cannot provide and should be an integral part of the core curriculum for all students.|benefit|Work-based learning gives students a first hand look at what their possible working environment could look like.
Providing students with meaningful work experiences that reinforce what they learn in school and expose them to a variety of career options will increase the chances of their being valued and hired by _________, and their making good career choices.|employers|Employers can only benefit from a new-hire who has already the experience of having participated in a workplace or workplace-like setting, as opposed to the rather limited academic environment currently provided.
Separate vocational and academic tracks should be replaced _________ at the high school level with programs of study that emphasize practical education for all. In the redesigned high school, technical and academic instruction should be merged, transforming high schools into active learning environments, similar to today's high-performance workplaces.|gradually|As a student discovers his/her career path choice, a gradual focus on this track will be beneficial to preparation for the workforce.
Students, as individuals and as team members, should be expected to master the basics, plan and complete projects, pose and solve problems, and present and explain their work through various _____.|media|Individuality as well as being a team player are key components sought after in today’s employees.  Being able to work, make decisions and plan on one’s own as well as with others is often a bare minimum for many employers seeking to hire.
A person that rates him or herself high on both masculine and feminine traits is ___________.|androgynous|Such a person may take an assertive or sensitive approach, depending on the situation.
The ___________ of secondary and postsecondary learning environments is critical to the development of rigorous programs of career-related education. Enrollment in postsecondary courses should figure prominently in program majors designed by students to add depth and focus to their high school education.|integration|Student participation in every level of this is key for complete development and preparation for the future.
Lifelong learning is defined in the as all learning activity undertaken throughout life, with the aim of _________ knowledge, skills and competence, within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective.|improving|It is becoming rare for a person to have only one career track in a lifetime, and it is therefore necessary for a person to learn how to learn, because even after finishing school, that person will have to continue learning new skills and information throughout their lifetime.
Students should learn to _____ the acquiring and updating of all kinds of abilities, interests, knowledge and qualifications from the pre-school years to post-retirement.|value|Learning to value abilities, interests, knowledge and qualifications is essential to being willing and able to keep up with the changing working environment of the present and the future.
It must be promoted to develop _________ and competencies that will enable each citizen to adapt to the knowledge-based society and actively participate in all spheres of social and economic life, taking more control of his or her future.|knowledge|The world and society of today is heading to a future that is more and more knowledge-based.  This makes a competency in knowledge fundamental to the ability to cope with and adapt to the world.
Moral education is becoming an increasingly popular topic in the fields of psychology and education. Media reports of increased violent juvenile crime, teen pregnancy, and suicide have caused many to declare a moral ______ in our nation.|crisis|
While not all of these social concerns are moral in nature, and most have complex origins, there is a growing trend towards linking the solutions to these and related social problems to the teaching of moral and social values in our public schools. However, considerations of the role schools can and should play in the _____ development of youth are themselves the subject of controversy.|moral|Morals themselves are hard to define.  As each person has a unique sense of morals and values, it is difficult to tell which are universal and should be promoted by schools.
Jean ______ is among the first psychologists whose work remains directly relevant to contemporary theories of moral development. He focused specifically on the moral lives of children, studying the way children play games in order to learn more about children's beliefs about right and wrong.|Piaget|The way children play games reveals quite a bit about their perspective towards life.  Following rules, sharing and communicating with others, as well as a great many other factors, expose general tendencies that the children may have towards other, every-day situations.
According to Piaget, all development emerges from action; that is to say, individuals construct and reconstruct their knowledge of the world as a result of interactions with the environment. Based on his observations of children's application of _____ when playing, Piaget determined that morality, too, can be considered a developmental process.|rules|Piaget believed that the way people deal with and apply rules is an almost direct reflection of the moral values of the person.
Piaget concluded from this work that schools should emphasize cooperative ________-making and problem solving, nurturing moral development by requiring students to work out common rules based on fairness.|decision|Piaget believed that if children work together to establish common rules, they will have a greater sense of moral obligation to others and a stronger moral foundation.
Piaget suggested that a classroom teacher perform a difficult task: the educator must provide students with opportunities for personal _________ through problem solving, rather than indoctrinating students with norms.|discovery|Piaget believed that by allowing children to discover the best decisions and answers on their own, they are better able to learn, as opposed to simply memorizing and blindly accepting what the teacher tells them.
Competency-based teacher education is an approach that requires prospective teachers to demonstrate _______ levels of performance on specified teaching tasks in actual or simulated situations.|minimum|An example of competency-based teacher education is instead of having a teacher candidate identify an appropriate teaching strategy by answering questions on a test, the candidate may be required to teach a simulated class and then discuss the reasons for his or her teaching behaviors.
Not everything that stimulates our sensory receptors is transformed into a mental representation. Rather, we selectively attend to some objects and events and ______ others.|ignore|
If we could not select, we would be automatons reduced to responding to whatever stimulus happened to be the strongest at any moment. Our ________ would be influenced solely by whatever thought, memory, or impulse was passing through our minds, and we would have no goal-directed control over our actions.|behavior|The ability to choose what we take in as a mental representation allows us to organize our own goals, actions and decisions.
Attention, then, is an important cognitive key to planned, ________ behavior.|adaptive|Since selecting what our sensory receptors are allowed to sense is so important to being able to choose our own behavior, attention to what our sensory receptors sense is key.
Failures of attention play a major role in several severe mental disorders. Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are extremely distractible, presumably because they cannot ______ many external stimuli.|ignore|ADHD is one of many mental illnesses characterized by an inability to selectively ignore external stimuli.
Psychologists have developed many ways to assess normal and abnormal attention. For example, in the dichotic listening task, subjects wearing earphones are asked to repeat a message sent to one ear while ignoring a different message simultaneously sent to the _____ ear.|other|
As adaptive creatures, we humans need to know what is happening in the world around us. _________ tells us there are objects in the world outside ourselves; perception tells us what and where they are and what they are doing.|Sensation|The sensations that our sensory receptors give us allow us to interpret the world around us.
Together, our sensations and perceptions ____ our brains to the world and allow us to form mental representations of reality.|link|With the interpretation of the sensations, we can take our view of the world and make it into an understandable reality.
We know the world through many senses, including seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting. With more than 50 percent of our ________ cortex devoted to visual functions and much of the remainder devoted to audition (including speech), seeing and hearing are by far the most studied.|cerebral|
The ______ sense is amazing because we can create vivid, detailed representations of the world from rather fuzzy patches of light momentarily projected through the lens of the eye onto the retina. From this highly impoverished two-dimensional array of light and dark, we construct a complex three-dimensional mental model of the world around us.|visual|
We identify people and objects of specified shapes, sizes, and colors, located at specific places or moving across our field of view. The processes underlying this everyday miracle are still somewhat mysterious, but behavioral scientists specializing in sensation and perception are discovering the steps that transform retinal nerve firings into the internal ______ of daily life.|cinema|How we transform the transmissions of our 5 senses into a reality is a mystery studied heavily by behavioral scientists.
According to Thorndike's law of ______, any act that produces a satisfying effect in a given situation will tend to be repeated in that situation.|effect|This is known as the Law of Effect.  Thorndike and Skinner both played major roles in developing knowledge of operant conditioning.
The study of perception is one of the most ________ areas of psychology. Many perceptual processes, especially those involving vision and audition, are well understood and provide a vital bridge between neuroscience and behavioral science.|advanced|It has been heavily weighted to find and understand the link between the senses and behavior, especially when it comes to sight and hearing.
Much more must be learned about the influence of perception. One major mystery is how we identify the shapes of things--the configuration of contours and edges that populate our visual world. Another is how we move from identifying the shapes of objects to identifying the objects themselves. A third is how perception is influenced by a person's experiences, motives, ____________, and goals.|expectations|Perception is not an objective thing, it is heavily influenced by our experiences, our motives, our expectations, and our goals
Every aspect of daily behavior, even the ones as automatic as knowing who we are and where we live, is guided by ________ of past experiences.|memories|
Research scientists have distinguished three phases of memory. First, registering or encoding an event into a memory trace; next storing and retaining it over a period of time; and finally, __________ and using it to guide actions.|retrieving|Registering is the initial entrance and cataloging of  that which is to enter the memory.
Memory for a particular episode may fail due to errors in any of these _____ phases. Research is also uncovering many types of memory, each with distinctive characteristics and functions.|three|Although these three phases (registering, storing, retrieving) are standard to memory, many different kinds of memory are being discovered.
To study memory in humans, researchers have devised simple laboratory tasks that permit memory reports to be compared with what actually happened. Subjects may be asked to study a ____ of words or view a set of pictures or novel shapes.|list|Although such situations seem far removed from everyday remembering, this research has yielded surprising insights into how memory works.
Memory ________ can be greatly effected by lifestyle.  The brain is like a muscle; it remains strong and flexible when exercised.|capacity|
Also, staying physically ______ greatly benefits the memory. Researchers have long maintained the strong link between a healthy body and a strong mind.|active|
Reduced stress load means a better ability to learn and ______. |recall|Taking time to relax, learning stress reduction methods, and getting a restful night's sleep whenever possible have an immeasurable impact on memory capacity.
____ Term Memory is defined as the memory system that is responsible for storing information on a relatively permanent basis.|Long|Long term memory is the memory we should be able to remember indefinitely and includes semantic memory (knowledge about the external world; i.e. what a bus pass is used for), episodic memory (memory for specific events in time), and procedural memory (how to use objects or move the body)
___________ rehearsal is a mechanism for processing information into long-term memory that involves the meaningful manipulation of the information to be remembered. |Elaborative|In other words, the stored memory needs to be elaborated upon to make sense of the information given.  This may be especially true if the memory was of a complicated situation in childhood where the information could not be fully comprehended.
Long Term Memory seems to be more prone to semantic  interference than Short Term Memory and is generally considered a permanent memory store. However, experiments that showed semantic interference in short term memory and phonological interference in long term memory have lead some researchers to reject the distinction as ___________.|meaningless|Semantic interference seems to have a greater impact on long-term memory than short-term memory.
Prompt _________ of items from long-term memory is highly dependent on the familiarity of items as well as the manner in which items have been stored in memory. |retrieval|For example, when listening to a speech, the listener may be placing equal emphasis on all of the components of speech rather than on those pertinent to understanding the crucial ideas being conveyed.
The three most significant things that help something move from short-term memory to long-term memory are organization, meaningfulness, and _______. |imagery|This is why it helps to put things into headings and subheadings, or to use outlines.
It is easier to remember things that are relevant to you, that have meaning for you: for example, things about your family rather than of others’ families, or classes in your major rather than gen-ed, and so on. And if you can put your experiences into explicit ______ form, you will remember it better.|visual|Human beings are very visual creatures.  Being able to visualize an experience can help you to remember it more easily later.
Simplified, the process of memory involves receiving, ________, storing, and recalling data.|encoding|Encoding is the first stage of transferring something to memory, followed by storing, and recalling.  Encoding has also been referred to as registering and is the process through which patterns are translated into appropriate brain language for long term storage.
Encoding is defined as the way ___________ is put into memory.  Sensory stimuli from the environment is represented in a perceptive form, i.e., sound, visual image, meaning, etc. |information|Encoding takes places in different stages of memory; it does not always register all of the information--some is lost during the encoding process.
Psychologists refer to storing memories as an encoding process--a procedure for ____________ something a person sees hears, thinks, or feels into a memory.|transforming|
The Individuals with ____________ Education Act (IDEA) requires the least restrictive placement for students, and protects certain rights of students and their parents.|Disabilities|IDEA requires states to develop procedures for educating each child in the least restrictive placement, or a setting that is as normal as possible.  This has led to mainstreaming--allowing disabled students to study in general classrooms when they have the ability to meet the expectations for that setting.
Chunking is the basis for the organization of memory.  Chunking is the _______ mechanism for learning and represents the conversion of problem-solving acts into long-term memory.|primary|Chunking involves combining information into chunks, instead of remembering the individual bits.  For example, instead of remembering the letters t,n,a,r,i, it would be easier to chunk it into one unit--train--and remember that word instead of the individual letters.
Fourteen letters is difficult for most people to store in their _____-term memory.  But you can use a technique called chunking to increase the capacity of short term memory. Instead of trying to remember 14 letters you must first chunk the letters into larger units.  |short|For example, with a 14 letter group such as XIBMSATMTVPHDX, you would have a much easier time remembering X, IBM, SAT, MTV, PHD, and X, instead of trying to remember 14 individual letters.
Chunking the 14 letters into 6 chunks as shown above, it is easy to keep all the letters in short term memory. The ____is to actively chunk letters, words, sentences, or numbers such that there are 7 or less chunks.|key |It is generally said that short-term memory can hold 7 individual items, that's why you want to limit to 7 or less chunks.
Mental imagery is defined as an experience that resembles __________ experience, but which occurs in the absence of the appropriate stimuli for the relevant perception.|perceptual|Sometimes colloquially called visualization, or seeing in the mind's eye.  For example, being able to hear someone in your imagination, or picture someone doing something, even though your senses are not actually conveying those stimuli, would be use of mental imagery.
______ imagery has often been believed to play a very large, even pivotal, role in both memory and motivation.|Mental|Very often mental imagery experiences are understood by their subjects as echoes or reconstructions of actual perceptual experiences from their past; at other times they may seem to anticipate possible, often desired or feared, future experiences.
The increasing interest in mental imagery began when the hold of ___________ weakened and psychologists began to explore the neglected mental processes covered in studies of imagery and imagination.|behaviorism|Behavioral scientists have lost interest in mental imagery in favor of the mental processes between mental imagery and the imagination.
Mental _______ is important as it occurs in many cognitive tasks.  It may help to understand related phenomena, and it may be useful to understanding how to elicit imagery during therapy.|Imagery|Some related phenomena which Mental Imagery may help us to understand are hallucinations, daydreaming, and dreaming.  
Mental imagery and its associated representations have been demonstrated to play an important role in dynamic _______ solving.|problem|
Research investigating the _______ of mental imagery on student learning has lagged behind research in other types of learning strategies. |effects|This is unfortunate in light of the fact that research in visual imagery has been shown to enhance the type of deep level conceptual connections that facilitate both recall and comprehension of verbal learning.
It follows that the conceptual connections that result from imagery in ______ learning will also facilitate spatial learning and problem solving.|verbal|
_______-solving is the process of achieving a desired goal for which there was initially no familiar outcome.|Problem|Problem solving involves making a plan and working through it, where the outcome is uncertain.
Learning enables improved _______-solving performance.|problem|Learning and problem-solving are related.  As one continues to learn, problem solving abilities are improved.  Problem solving identifies areas where you need knowledge, and learning provides that knowledge.
Different models of problem solving recognize different knowledge needs, and set up different learning tasks. Some recent models analyze problem solving in terms of _______ tasks, methods, and subtasks. |generic|These models require the learning of problem-solving concepts such as new tasks and new task decompositions. We view reflection as a core process for learning these problem-solving concepts.
Problem-solving is the key process in learning, because rendering a goal familiar renders _______ goals familiar.  This familiarity brings about the change in behavior when encountering similar goals that is required for learning to have taken place.|similar|As we learn and work to solve a problem, we become familiar with it.  Being familiar with similar problems when you encounter them in the future is an indicator that learning has taken place.
Learning to problem-solve is analogous to learning to _____.|learn|Since learning and problem-solving are so closely related, when we learn to solve a problem, we are also learning to learn.
_______-based learning prepares students to think critically and analytically, and to find and use appropriate learning resources.|Problem|Problem based learning is an instructional method that challenges students to learn to learn, working cooperatively in groups to seek solutions to real world problems. These problems are used to engage students' curiosity and initiate learning the subject matter.
The Transfer of learning is the transfer of a skill from one _________ to another; the transfer of a thought process or cognitive process to a practical situation.|situation|
There are _____ primary types of learning transfer that are recognized by educators for their ability to convey knowledge effectively.|three|Conveyance of knowledge involves three types of learning transfer: Within-Trial Transfer, Across-Trial Transfer, and Across-Task Transfer.
The first type of learning transfer is Within-Trial Transfer.  When chunks are created, they are available for immediate application. Thus, within a single problem solving session, ______ may be applied as soon as they are learned.|chunks|Chunking makes a large topic easier to absorb as it is broken down into manageable parts.  With this type of learning transfer, you can use these chunks as soon as they are created, within the same problem-solving session.
Secondly, ______-Trial Transfer occurs as chunks are created; system performance over different instances of the same problem improves.  This transfer is a direct result of chunking's ability to generalize.|Across|While chunks are created, familiarity increases, so the ability to deal with the same problem improves in speed and ease.  In this type of learning transfer, you apply the same chunks more efficiently to the same problem when you encounter it again in the future.
Finally, there is Across-Task Transfer, applying knowledge learned in one ______ to another.|domain|In one sense, this can be viewed as a form of analogical learning. However, the analogies can be very simple.  This type of learning transfer means applying the chunks learned in one problem to a different problem.
_________ conditioning refers to an automatic response being conditioned into a person's behavior, whereas operant conditioning deals with a learning process where a person takes a deliberate action in response to a certain stimuli.|Classical|Classical conditioning refers to things like a shiver running down your spine whenever you hear a fox howl, or flinching when someone lifts their hand.  On the other hand, operant conditioning might be something like pushing a button next to the door, because you've learned through experience that if you don't push the button, you will get zapped by the door knob.
Classical conditioning occurs when a _______ reflex is associated with a new stimulus.|natural|A natural reflex is something such as wincing, shivering, drooling--something that you don't think about.
Essentially, animals and people are biologically wired so that a certain stimulus will produce a specific response.  However, a Russian physiologist named Pavlov discovered _________ conditioning when he was able to make a dog salivate simply by ringing a bell.|classical|Ivan Pavlov was able to associate an automatic response, or natural reflex, in this case salivating, with a stimulus it normally does not respond to--a bell ringing.
The essence of Classical Conditioning is that two things are already connected with each other (Pavlov’s example is food and salivation). Then a third thing is added (the bell) for several trials. Eventually, this third thing may become so strongly __________ that it has the power to produce the old behavior.|associated|In Pavlov’s experiment, he used the association with an otherwise unrelated stimulus, to create the same reaction as a natural reflex.
__________ Anxiety is a developmental stage during which the child experiences anxiety when separated from the primary care giver (usually the mother).|Separation|Separation Anxiety is a stage most children go through, and usually ends by around 2 years of age.
The _________ application of classical conditioning involves emotion.|strongest|Common experience and careful research both confirm that human emotion conditions vary rapidly and easily. Particularly when the emotion is intensely felt or negative, it will condition quickly.
Classical conditioning is used by trainers for two purposes: The first purpose is to _________ (train) autonomic responses, such as drooling, producing adrenaline, or reducing adrenaline (calming) without using the stimuli that would naturally create such a response.|condition|Conditioning is training for a specific desired response.
If you are trying to make a general conclusion about the 8th grade students in your school, then you need to perform the experiment on a ______ sample.|random|For any experiment to be conclusive, it must be performed on a random sample.  For example, let's say you try one teaching style with one of your classes, a different teaching style with another, and one class performs better than the other.  You can't conclude that one of those teaching styles is better, because the classes don't consist of randomly selected students.  It could be that you have better students in one class than the other.
One key concept of Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development is accommodation--________ your way of thinking in response to new information.|altering|Accommodation occurs when a person must change their current world view in responce to a situation.  For example, if a boy believes that all rocks sink in water, then sees some volcanic rock floating on water, he will adjust his thinking to believe that most rocks sink.  This process is accommodation.
______s, in Piaget’s theory, are one’s organized mental representations of the world.|Schema|
Equilibrium is a term used by Piaget to describe a hypothetical innate drive that forces a person to actively pursue cognitive __________. In this view, children have a natural inclination toward cognitive development. |adaptation|It is likely that this driving force has external factors like the expectations of parents, teachers, and peers to learn, understand, and communicate new ideas with them. 
According to ______, cognitive disequilibrium occurs when a new experience does not fit existing understanding.|Piaget|When this happens, an individual falls into a state of cognitive disequilibrium, a state of confusion brought on by this imbalance.
The second purpose of classical conditioning is to create an ___________ between a stimulus that normally would not have any effect on the animal and a stimulus that would.|association|Association means that though initially the stimulus was unrelated to the response, the animal has learned to connect it with another stimulus which produces that response.
Thorndike's first of three observations was the Law of ______, which stated that behaviors followed by reward are strengthened and behaviors followed by punishment are weakened.|Effect|Punishment makes a behavior less likely to occur, whereas reward will strengthen a behavior, according to Thorndike.  Dog owners use this principle when they punish and reward a dog to show what kind of behavior is appropriate.
Law of Effect is a principle of learning that holds that ________ is acquired by the virtue of its consequences.|behavior|Behavior is a direct result of consequences that have occurred around that behavior.
A ________ correlation means that increasing one factor reduces another factor.|negative|A negative correlation between two factors means when one goes up, the other goes down.  For instance, there is usually a negative correlation between studying and failing.  Increased studying usually means fewer failed classes.
Thorndike called the pleasant events as satisfying and unpleasant events as annoying, and both of them play a critical part in learning. Thorndike’s Law of Effect defines what has become known as ____________ learning.|instrumental|
Moreover, this law suggested a connection between the stimulus and the response, and not between the response and the ______.|reward|According to Thorndike’s Law of Effect,  the stimulus and response have a connection, whereas the response and the reward do not.
Operant Conditioning forms an ___________ between a behavior and a consequence.|association|Operant conditioning is also called RS, or response-stimulus conditioning because it forms an association between the animal's response [behavior] and the stimulus that follows [consequence]
The Consequences of ________ according to Operant Conditioning: <br>Something Good can start or be presented;<br>Something Good can end or be taken away;<br>Something Bad can start or be presented;<br>Something Bad can end or be taken away.|Behavior|Operant condition has four possible consequences depending on behavior.  These consequences help form an association between a behavior and a consequence.
________ defined three levels of moral reasoning--preconventional, conventional, and postconventional.  An important aspect of conventional moral reasoning is that moral judgement is based on approval.|Kohlberg|Approval from family, peers, etc is important to a person who is in the Conventional Moral Reasoning stage.  Kohlberg believed that few adolescents can go beyond the Conventional stage into the Postconventional stage.  The Postconventional stage is where other people's approval no longer determines morals; in this stage people reason through to their own sense of what makes an action right.
One criticism of Kohlberg's research was that it was based almost entirely on research with ____ subjects.|male|Carol Gilligan believed Kohlberg overlooked significant gender differences and has suggested that a morality of caring or compassion is an orientation that is more likely among females and deserves greater consideration.  She believed females develop a morality of care more than a morality of justice.
Consequences have to be immediate, or clearly linked to the ________.|behavior|If the consequences are not appropriately linked to the behavior, and performed immediately to assure this link, an association will not be made.  For example, if you punish a dog ten minutes after it urinates on your floor, it probably won't make the connection between its behavior (urination), and the consequence (punishment).
With verbal humans, we can explain the connection between the consequence and the behavior, even if they are _________ in time.|separated|Humans can also form verbal explanations for consequences, so the immediacy is not as critical.
It has sometimes been said that ______ is what organisms do.  Behaviorism is built on this assumption, and its goal is to promote the scientific study of behavior.|behave|
______ learning is defined as the process of learning by observing the actions of other people.|Social|Example: If a child witnesses her older brother earn good grades and receive praise from their parents, she may learn through this social learning process that she should work hard to make good grades as well to earn her parents praise, also. 
In social learning theory, anyone who ____________ a behavior that other people observe are known as models. |demonstrates|A model is a role model in a sense. The model displays certain actions and characteristics within a situation that others observe and often imitate. This behavior is also known as mirroring. 
Modeling is the acquisition of new responses through the _________ of another who responds appropriately.|imitation|This has proven to be an effective means of both teaching and learning, especially with a positive model for the subject to observe. 
Albert _______’s approach to learning is also cognitive in nature, but his added a decidedly social aspect to the process and for that reason is often referred to as the social theory. |Bandura|The central idea of this theory is that learning takes place through the observation and the imitation of models. What makes social learning theory social is the notion that we often learn from others. 
Behaviorism was introduced (1913) by the American psychologist John B. ______, who insisted that behavior is a physiological reaction to environmental stimuli. He rejected the exploration of mental processes as unscientific. |Watson|Behaviorism is a school of psychology which seeks to explain animal and human behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to environmental stimuli.
_______ epitomized the behaviorist approach more than any other psychologist.|Skinner|B.F. Skinner was the leading exponent of the school of psychology known as behaviorism, which explains the behavior of humans and other animals in terms of the physiological responses of the organism to external stimuli.  Like other behaviorists, he rejected unobservable phenomena of the sort that other forms of psychology, particularly psychoanalysis, had studied, concerning himself only with patterns of responses to rewards and stimuli. 
Perhaps the biggest ________ of behaviorism and the resulting social learning and social cognitive theories are their ease of application to real world examples.|strength|Behaviorism’s greatest advantage is its applications to the real world.  Other perspectives to learning can be more hypothetical, and difficult to apply to real life scenarios.
Information gathered for learning theories are often represented by statistics and facts, rather than theoretical concepts and _____. Therefore, applying them and measuring the outcome is much simpler.|ideas|Other fields of psychology can be a lot more theoretical, whereas learning theories tend to use concrete statistics and facts, making them easier to measure and make sense of.

The second principle to keep in mind when looking at schedules of reinforcement is--how reinforcement becomes _________ is a crucial determinant of our behavior;|available|As reinforcement becomes available, how available it is plays a greater role in determining our behavior.
The third principle to keep in mind when looking at schedules of reinforcement is--the context of reinforcement availability is crucial in determining the _______ that it exerts over us.|control|We must determine the amount of control reinforcements exert with regards to our behavior.  The context in which reinforcement is made available can influence how much control it exerts.
Many teachers use _____ economies in order to encourage appropriate classroom behavior.|token|Token economies are also known as token reinforcement systems, they involve allowing students to earn tokens for academic work and positive classroom behavior.  These tokens (play money, holes punched in a card, etc) can be cashed in for desired rewards (school supplies, class privileges, etc).
Token economies require high levels of teacher commitment, time and skill and should be undertaken only when less intrusive measures, such as reinforcement and ____ management have been tried and have failed.|rule|Reinforcement refers to encouraging existing behaviors or teaching new ones--to encourage behavior is to reinforce it.
________’s Theory of Moral Development proposes three major levels of moral development, with two sub-stages for each level. |Kohlberg|The result is six stages of moral development. Kohlberg’s classification can be outlined in the following manner:<br><center><img style='background-color:#000080;' src=http://www.instantcertonline.com/members2/intropsych/kohlberg.gif></center>
The first step in planning a token economy system is identifying target _________.|behaviors|Identifying target behaviors allows us to specify exactly what we are trying to accomplish by implementing this system.  For example, target behaviors might be improvements in grades, politeness, or other desired behaviors.
With an intermittent reinforcement schedule, where a behavior is reinforced sometimes, instead of all the time, extinction takes ______.|longer|With an intermittent reinforcement schedule, you might randomly award desired behavior, or do it at specific time intervals.  The benefit is that it slows down extinction--it takes longer for the student to lose the behavior.
_________ Learning Theory is a general approach that views learning as an active mental process of acquiring, remembering, and using knowledge.|Cognitive|
The cognitive learning theory requires _______ active processes in the brain.|several|Learning is evidenced by a change in knowledge which makes a change in behavior possible. Learning itself is not directly observable--you look for changes in behavior to indicate that learning has occurred.
Stimuli produces brain activity, which stores the information in _____ term memory.|short|
Flashbulb memories are vivid, long lasting and detailed memories caused by highly ___________ events.|significant|The term was first coined by Brown and Kulik in 1977.  Examples of events which have caused flashbulb memories are the deaths of John Kennedy and Princess Dianna.  People who were alive when these events happened can often not only remember details about the events, but also remember trivial details such as how they heard about it, where they were, what they were doing, etc.
The information is moved from the short term to the long term memory according to its meaning, after it has been ___________.|assimilated|From the short-term memory, the stimulus experiences an assimilation process, placing it into long-term memory.
This information is combined with further information to produce new knowledge or it is transformed into an ______.|action|The information that has been assimilated is transferred either into knowledge or action, depending on the type of information.
In cognitive behavior modification, students are taught directly how to use ____-instruction.|self|Self-instruction involves thinking and self-talk, that is why it counts as a cognitive behavior modification, as opposed to a behavioral approach.  Examples are asking yourself questions while you're reading--Does this make sense?; Am I working fast enough?; Can I do what he's saying to do?

On the other hand, Vygotsky is known for his sociocultural perspective on cognitive development.  Vygotsky believed that you can't define specific stages universal to everyone; cognitive development depends on the child's culture and social interaction.

The practice of talking to ________ is known as private speech.|yourself|Private speech was referred to as egocentric speech by Piaget.  Piaget and Vygotsky had two very different views--Piaget saw egocentric speech in a negative way; the least socially and cognitively mature children use more egocentric speech.  On the other hand, Vygotsky saw it in a positive way; private speech develops out of social interaction with others.
________ stated that every function in a child's cognitive development appears twice.|Vygotsky|
According to Vygotsky, every function in a child's cognitive development first appears on the ______ level, then later on the individual level.|social|
A second aspects of ________'s theory is the idea that the potential for cognitive development is limited to a certain time span which he calls the zone of proximal development.|Vygotsky|In other words, at a certain age, there is a specific limit to a child's potential for cognitive development.
Furthermore, full development during the Zone of ________ Development depends upon full social interaction.|Proximal|Vygotsky believed that social interaction is the key to a child's cognitive development, so while there is a limit to a child's potential at a certain age, for him to reach that potential, there needs to be a certain level of social interaction.

With language so close to the ____ of what it means to be human, it is not surprising that children's acquisition of language has received so much attention. Anyone with strong views about the human mind would like to show that children's first few steps are steps in the right direction.|core|As language is one of the main defining factors between humans and all other animals, the development of the human mind with regards to language acquisition is heavily studied.
When creating standardized tests, it is important to give everyone an equal opportunity.  Questions with a ________ bias should be avoided.|cultural|For example, some people believe that the SATs, used to predict student success in college, are not fair to members of cultural or ethnic minority groups.

The ______ is a measure of central tendency.|median|Median is the value of a set of numbers that divides it exactly in half. There are as many scores above the median as below it. For example, in the following set of numbers: 1, 4, 1, 7, 9... 4 is the median, because if you arranged the numbers in order, 4 would be the middle number. 
The ____ is the most frequently occurring value in a set or distribution of scores.|mode|Given the following set of numbers: 1, 4, 1, 7, 9... the mode would be 1, because that occurs more than any other number in the group.

Each stage is associated with specific drives, conflicts, and defenses.
There are four _______ aspects to psychological development during adolescence.  First there is the physical:  bodily changes, preoccupation, and self consciousness (Am I normal?).|primary|This includes sexual identity development and sexual activity.

Erikson defined eight stages of human development, and each stage is characterized by a different psychological crisis.  The crisis in the Adolescent stage is ________.|identity|Erik Erikson's Adolescence stage lasts from Age 12 to 18, and during this time humans deal with the Identity Crisis--Who am I?  Erikson considered this the single most significant conflict a person must face.
Maslow came up with the _________ of Needs. Needs towards the bottom of the hierarchy must be fulfilled before needs towards the top become a motivator. |Hierarchy|Abraham Maslow is known for his hierarchy of needs. At the bottom are the basic physiological needs, such as food and water. We may lack many things in life, but if we lack food, we will probably choose to eat before doing anything else--like work or study.

True or false?  A man in his mid thirties can usually remember a longer string of numbers than a 1st grader, because he has greater memory capacity. _____|FALSE|The answer is false.  He does not necessarily have greater memory capacity, but most likely his mind automatically uses memorization techniques like chunking to allow him to store a longer string of numbers in only 7 short memory slots.

As a result, they don't accept responsibility for their failure, even in situations where they do have control over the ultimate outcome of their actions.
Self-__________ of ability has both a direct and an indirect influence on self-worth.|perception|The direct link demonstrates that the mere perception of high ability can sometimes imply worthiness, even without the presence of accomplishments.
Teachers tend to reinforce the concept that trying hard is a worthy activity, so there is a linkage for the student between ______ and self-worth.|effort|However, again, performance is needed to maintain this worthiness.
It is impossible to determine whether students who are more _____________ motivated elicit more support at home or whether more support at home leads to more intrinsic achievement motivation (or both).|intrinsically|A person with intrinsic motivation is self motivated.
Motivation for achievement includes _____ generic motivational factors that influence outcome attainment.|three|The first of the three motivational factors which can influence outcome attainment is a person's attitude or belief about his capability to attain the outcome.  For example, a person who doesn't think he can do something may not perform as well as if he believes in his abilities.
The second of three motivational factors which makes up motivation for achievement is a _____ or desire to attain the outcome.|drive|Kirsch presented subjects with a hypothetical feared task, specifically picking up a snake and holding it in front of their face, and asked them whether they would be able and willing to do it. They reported having neither capability nor inclination. He then offered them a progressively stronger incentive (namely, more money), and eventually reached a level where all subjects reported both the capability and willingness to perform the feared task. He also found that subjects would continuously perform a task for which they had little expectation for success, namely throwing a wadded-up piece of paper across a room into a wastebasket, if the consequence for success was a considerable reward and the punishment for failure was zero.
A student studies diligently for his exams the first semester, and ends up with poor grades.   As a result, he doesn't study for his exams during the second semester.

Locus of _______ is a construct which refers to an individual's beliefs about whether the outcomes of their actions are dependent on what they do (internal control orientation) or are determined by events outside their personal control (external control orientation).|control|The locus of control occurs when a person decides whether what has occurred is a result of their actions or of actions outside their control.
Some research suggests that what underlies the internal locus of control is the concept of self as _____. |agent|An outcome of an action falls into the internal locus of control when we believe that our actions resulted in the outcome.  The concept of self as agent is that our thoughts control our actions and that when we realize this executive function of thinking we can positively affect our beliefs, motivation, and academic performance.
A Reinforcement Schedule determines when you reinforce a new behavior you are trying to encourage.  The quickest way to make a person learn a new behavior is a __________ reinforcement schedule.|continuous|A continuous reinforcement schedule means you reinforce for every correct response--every time a student gets an A you give him a cookie.

A stimulus that evokes an emotional or physiological response that it normally would not evoke is a(n) ___________ stimulus.|conditioned|A conditioned stimulus is a stimulus you respond to because you have been conditioned to react to it.  For example, if you feel unsettled every time you pass a lake you almost drowned in, then the lake has become a conditioned stimulus for that feeling of unsettlement.
There are ___ types of explanations according to the attribution theory.  One, we can make an external attribution.|two|
The second type of explanation we can give, according to the ___________ Theory, is an internal attribution.|attribution|
Knowledge about your own thinking processes is called _____________.|metacognition|Metacognition is a person's awareness of his own cognitive machinery and how the machinery works--in other words, an understanding of how you yourself think, learn, etc..  Knowing that you learn better visually rather than simply hearing something is metacognition.
An external attribution assigns causality to an _______ agent or force.|outside|An external attribution claims that some outside thing motivated the event.
_____________ a problem to see things in a new way is an example of creativity.|Restructuring|Creativity is defined as imaginative, original thinking or problem solving.  It is often associated with divergent thinking--the ability to propose many different ideas or answers.
By contrast, an internal attribution assigns causality to factors ______ the person. |within|

__________ thinking is the reduction or focusing of many different ideas into one possible problem solution.|Convergent|
Deductive reasoning consists of drawing conclusions which follow _________ provided that certain statements are assumed to be true.|logically|Syllogisms (logical tasks which consist of two statements and a conclusion) use deductive reasoning, . For example: Dallas is in Texas.  Texas is in the United States.  Dallas is in the United States.   
The theory of learned helplessness began as a Pavlovian experiment and was later extended to human behavior, providing a model for explaining __________, a state characterized by a lack of affect and feeling.|depression|Depressed people became that way because they learned to be helpless. They learned that whatever they did is futile. During the course of their lives, depressed people apparently learned that they have no control.
Negative reinforcement involves strengthening behavior by ________ an aversive stimulus when the behavior occurs.|removing|An aversive stimulus is something unpleasant.  An example of a negative reinforcer is the car seatbelt buzzer.  Attaching the seatbelt (the desired behavior), results in the car buzzer stopping (aversive stimulus taken away).  This is different from positive reinforcement, where a stimulus is given in response for the proper behavior--i.e. giving someone a cookie for doing well.
Learned helplessness explained a lot of things, but then researchers began to find __________--people who did not get depressed, even after many bad life experiences.|exceptions|The theories around learned helplessness and depression became discredited after a while, as there was no consistency between learned helplessness and the development of depression.
________ discovered that a depressed person thought about the bad event in more pessimistic ways than a nondepressed person.|Seligman|He called this thinking, explanatory style, borrowing ideas from attribution theory.
Seligman suggests in his book Learned Optimism that one can overcome depression by learning new explanatory styles. This is the basis of cognitive therapy. In such therapies, the counselor challenges the client's beliefs and explanations of ____’s events.|life|If you feel depressed because you failed that last exam, then dispute the explanation, and learn or search for a more optimistic one according to the above criteria. Or read a few jokes. The whole self-help movement is based on the optimistic belief that we can change ourselves for the better.
Reinforcement is the most widely _______ principle of behavioral analysis.|applied|Reinforcement is the most commonly used and accepted method of behavioral analysis.
Intrinsic means innate or within; hence intrinsic motivation is the stimulation or drive stemming from ______ oneself.|within|

Intrinsic motivation is often associated with intrinsic rewards because the natural rewards of a task are the __________ forces that encourage an individual in the first place.|motivating|When one can receive a natural reward for an achievement, it is thought to be much easier to develop a natural, intrinsic motivation to perform.
The basic idea behind intrinsic motivation and intrinsic rewards is that ________, both searching for answers and finding those answers, is reinforcing in itself.|learning|It is thought that if a student is intrinsically motivated to learn, then it is the learning that is also the reward.  Therefore the learning is reinforcing itself.
An intrinsically __________ classroom works: it is utilizing the natural learning energy of children!|motivating|Children are the most curious, naturally driven learners on the face of this Earth.
One of the big debates that many people discuss is the ______-Nurture controversy.|Nature|The Nature vs. Nurture debate is also sometimes known as the genetic-environmental controversy.
In this controversy, we ask if the behavior of people is due to Nature (a person's ________) or Nurture (a person's environment). This is a philosophical question to which science offers no definite answer.|genetics|The two sides of the debate are Nature and Nurture.  Nature says that genetics are responsible for certain behavior, whereas Nurture says that a person's environment, upbringing, education, etc. are responsible for that same behavior.
In short, the ______ to the question Is X caused by the environment or is it genetic? is usually--both.|answer|The answer is usually both.  It is now believed that behavior is caused by a combination of both nature and nurture.

These tests, in many cases, are seen as biased for a number of reasons including the social and economic status of an individual during his upbringing.
Mental ___________ is determined by a below average level of intellectual functioning, usually defined by an IQ of below 70 to 75, combined with limitations in the skills necessary for daily living. |Retardation|Daily living skills include such things as communication, the ability to care for oneself, and the ability to work.
The _______ intelligence theory was first proposed by British psychologist Charles Spearman.|general|Spearman postulated that an overriding kind of intelligence that he called a general factor or general intelligence G is determined exclusively by inheritance.
Binet and Simon developed a concise,  easy to administer measure of ____________ which became popular by 1916.|intelligence|Performance on the Binet Simon test was the basis for determining IQ (intelligence quotient).  Binet believed the scores should only be used to identify children in need of special education and that with proper training even children with low test scores could benefit greatly.
Gardner developed a theory of ________ intelligences (MI) and created a list of criteria to measure eight different intelligences or ways of learning.  |multiple|Howard Gardner rejected the idea of a single IQ score as an adequate measure of human intelligence. 
Yet with the surge in new intelligence ________, many of these theories and their potential applications remain under-examined. |theories|There are more intelligence theories being developed than resources that can study them.

Robert _________'s triarchic theory of successful intelligence includes three components: analytical, creative and practical.|Sternberg|The Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test (STAT) was created to evaluate the components of Sternberg's theory.  It includes analytical questions to measure the ability to learn from context and reason; creative questions to assess the ability to cope with new situations; and practical questions to assess the ability to solve everyday problems.
There are so many different theories and applications for gifted children, that many have not been utilized for very minor reasons.  But how to organize the multitude of intelligence theories? Both _________ and Gardner, Kornhaber, and Wake propose classification schemes in their texts on intelligence.|Sternberg|
Sternberg suggests that we view intelligence theories in terms of the _________ on which they are based: geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, anthropological, sociological, and systems.|metaphors|Theories of intelligence should be applied with the metaphors that relate to the subject in question.
Gardner, _________, and Wake take the more traditional approach--to classify these theories based on their dominant perspective: psychometric, developmental, biological, cognitive, and recent.|Kornhaber|Gardner, Kornhaber, and Wake stick to the traditional, dominant perspectives that relate to the subject.
The guiding standard that opens the gates to remedial and support services in schools across the nation, the ___________  formula, has undermined the ability of teachers to provide timely and effective assistance for students with learning disabilities who are struggling in school.|discrepancy|
It virtually requires that students crash and burn academically before they can gain access to special education services and it reinforces failure, ultimately making ___________ much more difficult.|remediation|In accordance with the discrepancy formula students must reach rock bottom before help becomes available, and then remediation is much more difficult.
Unlike achievement tests such as the SAT II, which assess mastery of specific subjects, the SAT I is an ________ test that focuses on measuring verbal and mathematical abilities independent of specific courses or high school curricula.|aptitude|Every year more than a million high school students stake their futures on the nation's most widely used admissions test, the SAT I. Long viewed as the gold standard for ensuring student quality, the SAT I has also been considered a great equalizer in U.S. higher education.
The SAT I is therefore a valuable tool, the argument goes, for correcting the effects of grade inflation and the wildly varying _______ of U.S. high schools. |quality|Grade inflation is reduced, if not, eliminated with the assistance of this standardized aptitude test.  Grade inflation refers to the fact that a 4.0 GPA at one school may not be as difficult to achieve as a 4.0 GPA at another school.
The SAT I presumably offers a way of identifying ________ students who otherwise might not meet traditional admissions criteria, especially high-potential students in low-performing high schools.|talented|This test gives the additional assistance of identifying students who don’t fit the traditional model.
Research methods are a pivotal part of whether or not advances are made in unravelling the causes and consequences of reading disabilities or of the _____ of particular instructional techniques.|value|Research methods are essential to being able to identify and assist those with reading disabilities.
In a normal distribution or bell-shaped curve, __% of the scores are one standard deviation above the mean.|34|Also, 34% of the scores are 1 standard deviation below the mean--that means 68% of the scores are within 1 standard deviation below to 1 standard deviation above the mean.<br><center><img style='background-color:#000080;' src=http://www.instantcertonline.com/members2/edupsych/stndv.gif></center><br>
Attention to methodological issues has been a key reason the last twenty-five years of research on _______ has been so productive.|reading|
Reading development follows a very personal _________ for each child.|timetable|Children each have their own time with which their reading development will progress.
Kids start recognizing words at _________ ages, they learn to decode print at different times, they seem to spurt ahead in reading for a few months and then settle back and go nowhere for a while.|different|All of this is absolutely normal - and a fast or slow start doesn't seem to matter in the long run.
In a token reinforcement system, the _____ itself is known as the secondary reinforcer.|token|In and of itself, the token holds no value for a student.  Collecting enough of these tokens can allow a student to get what he really wants--the primary reinforcer.  For example, once he collects a certain amount of tokens, he might be awarded a free homework pass, or a candy bar, etc..
Memories that are stored permanently go into ____-term memory.|long|Short term memory does not store anything permanently; it moves memories that need to be kept for a longer duration to long-term memory.
Repeating information ________ either aloud or mentally is called rote rehearsal.  |verbatim|Rote rehearsal, also called maintenance rehearsal, is used for short term memorization.  An example is repeating a phone number aloud to one's self. 
When a new memory blocks our ability to recall old information this is called retroactive __________.|inhibition|The second thing learned has in some sense replaced the first in memory making it harder to recall the first.  Researchers have found that when a learning activity is followed by a similar learning without rest there is a great deal of retroactive inhibition.
Proactive __________ occurs when learning is inhibited because of something learned before.|inhibition|If we see a breed of dog we don't recognize but it looks similar to a terrier, we remember it as something like a terrier but not one.  When we try to remember what the dog looked like we'll remember terrier but will probably have forgotten the distinctive features of the dog we actually saw.  This is an example of proactive inhibition.
Sensory memory linked to ________ perception is called echoic memory.|auditory|Echoic memory is believed to play a key role in language processing.
Memories are stored in the sensory register, which includes the visual system and the auditory system. The visual copy is stored in the ______ memory.|iconic|The visual copy stored in the sensory store is called an icon. What goes on in the iconic memory is preconscious but a type high speed processing called preattentive processing occurs. Preattentive processing plays a powerful role in visual perception. 
Gifted students with disabling conditions remain a major group of underserved and understimulated youth.  The focus on accommodations for their ____________ may preclude the recognition and development of their cognitive abilities.|disabilities|It is not unexpected, then, to find a significant discrepancy between the measured academic potential of these students and their actual performance in the classroom. 
In order for these children to reach their potential, it is imperative that their ____________ strengths be recognized and nurtured, at the same time as their disability is accommodated.|intellectual|For the appropriate accommodations to be provided, we must first identify the unique intellectual strengths of the gifted child.
Accommodation and Assimilation are two key aspects of ______'s Theory of Cognitive Development.|Piaget|Accommodation is where a person must modify existing schemes to respond to a new situation.  Assimilation is where a person uses existing schemes to make sense of a situation--i.e. a boy who sees a skunk for the first time calls it a cat because he's trying to make sense of a new experience using an old one.
One of the three types of long-term memory is ________ memory--which is memory tied to a particular place and time, especially information about the events or episodes of your own life.|episodic|This type of long-term memory, where you remember something based on an event, is called episodic memory.  For example, your 18th birthday would fall into episodic memory.  On the other hand, you probably would not remember exactly when and where you learned what the word transportation meant, because definitions of words are not usually stored on the basis of time and location.
Identification of giftedness in students who are ________ is problematic.|disabled|The customary identification methods-standardized tests and observational checklists-are inadequate, without major modification. Standard lists of characteristics of gifted students may be inadequate for unmasking hidden potential in children who have disabilities.
An autistic student has a ______ disorder in communication, socialization, and academic skills.|severe|These students are limited in their ability to understand, communicate, learn, and take part in social relationships. Some students who are autistic may be able to learn a form of communication, simple self-care and daily living activities while others will need help in all areas.
A developmentally-_______ student has a delay in one or more of the following areas: adaptive or self help development, cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional development, or physical development.|delayed|This includes fine, gross or perceptual motor, in children ages birth through two years and three through five years of age.

With special help, most people with a hearing impairment can learn at least basic academic skills and how to communicate with other people.
A student profoundly ________ handicapped is significantly delayed in intellectual and adaptive behavior with development reflecting a reduced rate of learning.|mentally|These individuals require close supervision. Some PMH individuals may be able to do simple chores and self-help tasks, while others will need help in all areas.
A ______ impaired student has a delay in language or articulation that makes it hard for that person to communicate with others or to gain basic skills.|speech|With special help, most people with speech and language impairments can learn at least basic academic skills and learn how to communicate with others.
_______ from the environment constantly bombard us--we're constantly seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling things.  All of this initially goes into sensory memory.|Stimuli|All this stimuli goes into Sensory memory for initial processing.  It may only be there for a fraction of a second before it is ignored or discarded, or it may make it's way into working memory, and eventually long-term memory.  Sensory memory has an enormous capacity, but fragile duration--it can only hold something for one to three seconds.
In classical conditioning, __________ is when the conditioned response disappears.|extinction|For example, you may condition a dog to salivate every time you ring a bell by bringing it food soon after.  For a while, you'll be able to make it salivate just by ringing the bell.  But--if you continue to ring the bell, and never bring the food, eventually the dog is going to lose that conditioned response; it won't respond to the stimulus (the bell) anymore.
A visually impaired student has a loss of vision that interferes with learning, ____ with the best correction and treatment.|even|With special help, most people with a visual impairment can learn at least basic academic skills and how to move around in their environment as independently as possible.

________ gives the results of 308 studies of trying to teach children and students creativity. In 70% of these cases the attempts were successful.|Torrance|This research proved education increased creativity.
There are a lot of good ways, and some not so good. Good ways to teach creativity depend on the actual _______ of the country in which it is taught.|culture|There probably is no best way to teach creativity.
When teaching creativity in school, we must also take into account the actual school system of that _______.|country|E.g. what subjects are taught at what levels, what methods of education are used etc.
The ____ help prepare children to read and write by developing visual and motor skills.|arts|Performing creative tasks such as artistic activities helps children develop better motor skills.
Painting, drawing and sculpture also help children learn to make choices, use their ______ and express feelings.|memory|As creativity is personal, being artistic allows a child to exercise the memory and express feelings.
Guiding your children to enjoy art, can revitalize learning and open new avenues for __________.|expression|As creative arts have fewer boundaries, they often allow children to express feelings and thoughts that they are otherwise unequipped to express.
To understand and facilitate learning in any area of the curriculum, teachers should know not only what it is that is being acquired, but how it relates to what has already been _______.|learned|
The learning of culture, like the learning of language, begins with a child's first experiences with the ______ into which he is born, the community to which he belongs, and the environment in which he lives.|family|The learning of culture begins right at the very birth, when the baby joins the family and begins to receive sensations from his/her surroundings.
By the time children begin their formal education at the age of five or six, they have already internalized many of the basic ______ and beliefs of their native culture, learned the rules of behavior which are considered appropriate for their role in the community, and established the procedures for continued socialization; they have learned how to learn.|values|By the age when children are about to start school, they have already formed a great deal of their cultural beliefs.
Different child-_______ practices are preferred in different cultures, and these will have a significant effect on later learning.|rearing|
Child-rearing techniques range from being very lenient when compared to dominant group standards, with little physical restraint or coercion employed, to very ______ control of early behaviors.|strict|
The way parents _______ the daily routines and schedules at home conveys to children appropriate behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of the family and cultural community that should be learned.|arrange|Children unconsciously observe every aspect of the way parents live their lives, and make assumptions, judgments and decisions based on what they observe.
Culture has a direct impact on the skills children learn from ________.|routines|For instance, whether children learn to eat using utensils such as a spoon or chopsticks or learn to eat with their hands depends upon the family's culturally based mealtime routines and activities.
The ________ of the day or the way time is structured is also learned. Some cultural communities do not value or follow regular schedules for their home routines (e.g., set eating and sleeping times).|schedule|A baby who can adjust to continual changes in routines or situations is considered desirable. In other communities, the baby's adaptation to a regular routine is encouraged. In such communities, children learn to focus their attention on predictable patterns in the daily schedule.
Erik Erikson defined eight stages of human development.  The second stage involves the crisis of ________ (independence) vs. doubt.|Autonomy|Autonomy versus Doubt (or Shame) is Erikson's second stage.  It marks the beginning of self-control and self-confidence.
Discovery Learning involves presenting examples to students and letting them work with the examples until they discover the inter_____________.|relationships|Discovery learning is an approach in which students apply Inductive Reasoning to discover basic principles on their own.
_________ reasoning is associated with Discovery learning and involves formulating general principles based on knowledge of examples and details.|Inductive|In inductive reasoning, a student uses specific examples to formulate a general principle.  For instance, if students are presented with enough examples of parallelograms, eventually they will discover the basic properties of parallelograms.
Ideally, an ___________ should do more than ascertain how much the students have already learned|examination|It should be an opportunity for them to further their understanding by putting the course material into new contexts or patterns. Approaching this ideal is clearly more difficult in some courses than in others.
There are essentially two kinds of questions: subjective _____ questions and objective or short-answer questions.|essay|The distinction between subjective and objective is not always a clear one, however; frequently both subjective and objective elements are involved in a single question. Students should know in advance the type of question or combinations of types of questions that the test will include.
From one perspective, __________ in the class could be construed as preparation for the exams.|everything|Specifically, let the students know what kinds of questions will be asked, whether there will be selection from a list of options, what material will be included on each exam, and how the question will be weighted. It will be useful if students can consult exams from previous quarters.
Validity is the appropriateness or ___________ of inferences, decisions, or descriptions made about individuals, groups, or institutions from test results.|correctness|
There is no such thing as a generically _____ test.|valid|Validity must be considered in terms of the correctness of a particular inference about test takers.
___________ is the consistency of test scores over different test administrations, multiple raters, different test questions.|Reliability|
Tests can be categorized into two major groups: norm-referenced tests and _________-referenced tests.|criterion|
These two tests differ in their intended purposes, the way in which content is selected, and the scoring process which defines how the test results must be ___________.|interpreted|
A norm-referenced test is a test which measures a _______'s achievements against the standard established by a norm group.|learner|
_________-referenced tests determine ...what test takers can do and what they know, not how they compare to others.|Criterion|Criterion Referenced Tests report how well students are doing relative to a pre-determined performance level on a specified set of educational goals or outcomes included in the school, district, or state curriculum.
A _____ is an arbitrarily established set of numbers used for measurement according to a rate or standard.|scale|In testing, a scale is a way to report test scores.  For example, student grades are often based on the 4.0 GPA scale.  CLEP tests are based on a 0-80 scale--the max score is 80 points.
The Scaled _____ is a technique for averaging grades where the degree of difficulty varies from one assignment to the next.|score|A scaled score is designed to calculating the score earned on a test taking into account the difficulty.  For example, on one SAT test, you may be able to get more questions incorrect than on another SAT test, and still come out with the same score.
A ____-referenced test compares an individual's score to the average score of others in a larger group.  Nationwide standardized tests usually fall into this category.|norm|The goal of a norm-referenced test is to see a student's performance as it compares to other students.  A criterion-referenced test is designed to tell if students are ready for more advanced materials, a norm-referenced test is designed to see how a student compares to the average student.
The standard _________ is kind of the mean of the mean, and measures how widely the data varies from the average.|deviation|For example, the standard deviation for this set of numbers (5, 23, 44, 15) is greater than the standard deviation for this set (19, 20, 18, 22).
A normal deviation of data means that most of the examples in a set of data are _____ to the average, while relatively few examples tend to one extreme or the other.|close|
A heuristic is a general strategy used in attempting to solve problems, as opposed to an _________, which is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.|algorithm|A Heuristic might be something like dividing a problem into sub-problems, or working backwards through a problem, etc..  On the other hand, an algorithm is a specific set of steps you follow to solve a problem.  For instance, most math problems have an associated algorithm; most of life's problems are not that straightforward, and would be best solved with heuristics.
Scheuneman and Slaughter list five ______ that make test reliability suspect: historical, cultural, biological, educational, and psychometric.|biases|Reliability in testing becomes questionable due to these five reasons.
Unfair penalization occurs when items on an examination disadvantage one group over another because of different __________ experiences. |background|For example, immigrants might not score as well on a math test as native born students if the test included items requiring a knowledge of American football.
Standardized testing has received much criticism in recent years. Many feel that the tests are ______ against certain social and cultural groups.|biased|They argue that much of the information assessed on the tests is information that certain social and cultural groups have had limited exposure to.
Classroom __________ is a simple method that faculty can use to collect feedback, early and often, on how well their students are learning what they are being taught.|assessment|Classroom assessment helps teachers better know how their classrooms are functioning, on a number of levels.

College instructors use ________ gleaned through Classroom Assessment to make adjustments in their teaching.|feedback|Faculty also share feedback with students, using it to help them improve their learning strategies and study habits in order to become more independent, successful learners.
The three types of long-term memory are Episodic memory, Procedural Memory, and ________ memory.  |semantic|Semantic memory is memory for meaning.  Things such as word definitions, images, and other information that directly applies to making meaning of your world falls under semantic memory.  Basically, any long-term memory which is not episodic (associated with a time and location), or procedural (how to do something like ride a bike), is semantic memory.
The zone of proximal development is the area where the child cannot solve a problem alone, but can be successful under adult guidance or in _____________ with a more advanced peer.|collaboration|A teacher might apply this concept by evaluating a student's current level, and working with him individually to take him to the next level.  This makes more sense than trying to get all students to aspire to a certain level even though they all may be in different stages of ability.
Classroom Assessment is one method of _______ within the framework of Classroom Research, a broader approach to improving teaching and learning.|inquiry|Classroom research is a similar, yet broader approach to improving teaching and learning.
Most tests administered by teachers in classrooms are _________-referenced tests; they are designed to test mastery of certain objectives.|criterion|Criterion-referenced tests test for a certain level of performance.  For example, a math class would have a test that covers all of the different math concepts the students are expected to know by the end of the class.  In a criterion-referenced test, it doesn't matter what the other students get--the test-takers must demonstrate mastery.
The process of adding and extending meaning by connecting ___ information to existing knowledge is known as elaboration.|new|Elaboration helps people to remember information more easily.  Examples of elaboration are--while studying a textbook, picturing information in your mind, translating info into your own words, acting out relationships, creating examples, etc..
Faculty, and for that matter students, need effective ways of monitoring learning throughout the semester. Although individual instructors often do invent, discover, or simply stumble upon a strategy that works, these ________ discoveries rarely become a matter of public record.|informal|Thus, a few years ago, Thomas A. Angelo and K. Patricia Cross compiled a volume, Classroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for College Teachers, describing strategies that college teachers had found useful and that could be used as models for asking the fundamental but often elusive questions What are your students learning? and its corollary, How effectively are you teaching?
It is critical to define your goal before creating a ____ to reach it.|plan|On the topic of educational performance evaluations, Mager said:  You cannot concern yourself with the problem of selecting the most efficient route to your destination until you know what your destination is
According to Gronlund, teachers should formulate _______ objectives of instruction that describe types of behavior students should exhibit in order to demonstrate that they have learned (What you should know).|general|Plans should be made to be able to recognize that a student has learned appropriate behaviors and lessons.
There are _____ types of long-term memory--semantic, episodic, and procedural memory.|three|Procedural memory is memory for how to do things.  For example, how to tie your shoes, or how to ski are stored as procedural memories, and once learned probably will not be forgotten.
________: Under each general objective, list up to five specific learning outcomes (what you should be able to perform).|Gronlund|For each general objective that has been determined by the teacher, approximately five specific possible outcomes should be listed, so that they can be recognized when they occur.
___________ statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures.|Descriptive|Together with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.
___________ statistics are typically distinguished from inferential statistics. |Descriptive|With descriptive statistics you are simply describing what is or what the data shows. With inferential statistics, you are trying to reach conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data alone.
Descriptive Statistics are used to present ____________ descriptions in a manageable form. In a research study we may have lots of measures. Or we may measure a large number of people on any measure. Descriptive statistics help us to simplify large amounts of data in a sensible way.|quantitative|Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data into a simpler summary. For instance, consider a simple number used to summarize how well a batter is performing in baseball, the batting average. This single number is simply the number of hits divided by the number of times at bat.
Most programs in Instruction and Curriculum in the Content Areas are divided into elementary and _________ education and focus directly on the practice of teaching.|secondary|
One can develop expertise drawing from several distinct bodies of _________.|knowledge|A teacher can develop an expertise by concentrating on drawing knowledge from a number of different sources.

Preventive Management focuses on the different ________ and classroom management skills.|teaching|Preventive management also links closely with Supportive Management which concentrates on pupil-teacher relations.
__________ teaching is a technique developed to help readers improve their reading comprehension and involves four steps.|Reciprocal|The four steps include:  ask a question about the meaning of the passage, summarize the main idea, clarify unclear points (ideas, vocabulary etc) predict what will happen next.
Good ________ in action in the classroom usually seem to have no discipline problems at all.|teachers|But this is because they work hard at making sure these will not arise.
__________ Management focuses on developing and maintaining pupil-teacher relations.|Supportive|It is the other side of the coin to Preventive Management which concentrates on teacher skills, though both sections are very closely linked.
The rationale of _______ organizers is students are confronted on a daily basis with a great deal of unfamiliar material.|advance|Teachers can help students make sense out of this material if they take time at the outset of instruction to highlight the organizational and structural patterns of the new material and indicate how it relates to other material already learned.
One way that research has demonstrated to be effective in rendering assistance to teachers is the utilization of advance __________.|organizers|Advance organizers are short sets of verbal or visual information presented prior to learning a larger body of content.
The intent of advanced organizers is to present students with _______, not content; with conceptual frameworks, not specific detail.|context|They can provide students with new organizational structures to guide the assimilation of the new content.
Students with disabilities often have motivational problems because they feel that they have a lack of _______.|ability|Students with disabilities often have motivational problems not because they feel that they have shown a lack of effort, but a lack of ability.
_________ Learning promotes the development and use of discovery or inquiry-based methods of teaching and learning.|Discovery|This method is predicated on the belief that all students have creative ability which can be further developed utilizing the many techniques of inquiry-based learning.
There are two general types of intermittent reinforcement schedules--interval schedules and ratio schedules.  Interval schedules are broken down into fixed-interval and variable interval.  Ratio schedules are broken down into _____-ratio, and variable-ratio.|fixed|Fixed ratio means that after a set number of responses, reinforcement is provided.  For example, for every third A a student scores, he gets a cookie.  Variable ratio means that the number of correct responses required before reinforcement occurs varies--for example, a slot machine reinforces your behavior at a variable ratio, not at a fixed-ratio.
Whereas Piaget and Vygotsky placed emphasis on learners' personal construction of knowledge, Ausubel emphasized the importance of reception learning which is based on the idea that most of what is learned is acquired through the transmission of _____ and not through discovery.|ideas|Ausubel believes that the transmission of ideas and not through discovery, is how a learner creates their personal construction of knowledge.
Children in a classroom will often model themselves after the student with the highest ______ standing.|social|They will often model themselves after the student with the highest social standing, as opposed to the most studious, well-mannered student.
_______ believed that reception learning was an important means of acquiring certain discipline-based concepts as long as that learning made meaningful connections between the new information and the learner's pre-existing cognitive structures.|Ausubel|This means that it is through association of the learner’s pre-existing knowledge, that the learner is able to absorb and understand new things.
Cooperation is working together to accomplish shared _____.|goals|
Within cooperative activities, ___________ seek outcomes that are beneficial to themselves and beneficial to all other group members.|individuals|
Cooperative learning is the instructional use of small ______ so that students work together to maximize their own and each other's learning.|groups|Class members are organized into small groups after receiving instruction from the teacher. They then work through the assignment until all group members successfully understand and complete it.
A __________ score tells the percentage of people the student scored higher than.|percentile|For example, to score in the 70th percentile means that the student scored as well or better than 70% of the norming sample (the group of students whose score used as the basis for comparison).
By cueing learners about the ____________ of subject matter, by providing advance organizers, by scheduling student exercises and assignments appropriately and by helping learners make appropriate connections between concepts and ideas, teachers help students to remember information and form linkages between new material and material they've previously learned.|organization|Organization and Clarity are the essential ingredients.
One of the three processes involved in classical conditioning is discrimination--the ability to respond ___________ to similar, but not identical stimuli.|differently|Discrimination, as it applies to conditioning, refers to responding to one stimuli in one way, and then responding in a different way to similar, but different, stimuli.  For example, in gym class, running when the teacher blows the whistle once, but stopping when he blows it twice is an example of discriminating between two similar but different stimuli.
As a result of ____, passed in 1990, parents have the right to see all records relating to the testing, placement, and teaching of their child.|IDEA|IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) protects certain rights, such as allowing parents to see all records relating to the testing, placement and teaching of their child, and allows parents to obtain an independent evaluation of their child.  However--it does not guarantee mainstreaming for every disabled child.  Most schools do not integrate students with severe disabilities into normal classes.
While clarity is clearly an expected outcome of careful preparation and good organization, it is also correlated with teacher _________ of the subject.  Teacher uncertainty produces vagueness which inhibits student understanding.|knowledge|These principles of teaching and learning are time-honored and widely accepted elements of information processing theories of learning.
Students who perceive instruction to be well organized and _____ are thus likely to enjoy enhanced knowledge and understanding of course material.|clear|The Organization and Clarity factor is pertinent to several widely accepted principles of teaching and learning.
Teachers tend to ask more questions of ____-achieving students.|high|Studies have shown that teachers tend to talk more and ask more questions of high-achieving students.  With low-achieving students, teachers tend to ask less questions, give them less time to answer, and give them less prompts and cues to help them along.  They tend to be more encouraging in general toward those students for whom they have high expectations.
Teachers who set and communicate high ____________ for all their students obtain greater academic performance from their students than teachers who set low expectations.|expectations|Students tend to learn as much (or as little) as their teachers expect. Teachers with high expectations for all students can structure and guide behavior and can challenge students beyond what students themselves believe they can do.
This uniquely _____ phenomenon is called the Pygmalion Effect. It is a persistently held belief in another person such that the belief becomes a reality.|human|The person who is believed in, being believed, becomes the person whom they are perceived to be--the self fulfilling prophecy.
All the students becoming attentive when the teacher clears her throat is an example of a ___________ response.|conditioned|That is an example of a conditioned response.  A person clearing their throat is not a stimuli naturally associated with being quiet, sitting straight and looking forward.
The concept of ____-time as an instructional variable was invented by Mary Budd Rowe.|wait|The wait-time periods she found--periods of silence that followed teacher questions and students' completed responses--rarely lasted more than 1.5 seconds in typical classrooms. She discovered, however, that when these periods of silence lasted at least 3 seconds, many positive things happened to students' and teachers' behaviors and attitudes. To attain these benefits, teachers were urged to wait in silence for 3 or more seconds after their questions, and after students completed their responses.
_________ education is unquestionably a controversial issue.|Bilingual|There are a number of people and organizations in this country who, for various reasons, are opposed to bilingual education. Educators interested in bilingual education program development may find it useful to look for information on which types of programs are eligible for grants.
The fact that world economic growth is dependent on the English language is well established. The language of business, finance, science and technology is English. ___ instruction in the U.S. is serving this increasing worldwide demand.|ESL|ESL, or English as a Second Language.  Globally, English language training is estimated to be a $20 billion service industry.
There are two basic positions on bilingual education--__________ and maintenance.  The difference is in the role the native language plays.|transition|The different is in how the native language is treated.  With Transition, the goal is to introduce English as early as possible, so that the student can be taught in English.  With Maintenance, the idea is to maintain the native language, and use the native language as the primary teaching language until English skills are more fully developed.
Classroom ________ is a process of involving teachers in the formal study of teaching and learning.|research|
Classroom Research attempts to answer two fundamental questions: how well are students ________ and how effectively are teachers teaching.|learning|
Through close observation, the collection of feedback on student learning, and the careful design of experiments, classroom teachers can learn more about how students learn, and more specifically, how students _______ to particular teaching approaches.|respond|Classroom research examines different techniques and approaches of teaching to see how effective they are and how students respond to them.
