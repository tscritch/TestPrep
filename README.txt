This app was created summer of 2014 for my personal use to study for CLEP and DSST tests. However, I took the questions in the app from a site called instacert without permission (plus their security needs some work). I had a paid subscription at the time that I was able to access the questions. But, I don’t want to post those questions on here because I do not own them. I most likely won’t come back to this ever but take a look at it if you’re interested and feel free to email me!
