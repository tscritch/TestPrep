Psychologists believe that the personality, or our thought processes, actions, and capacity for emotions must actually be _______, and is part of becoming human.|learned|Although many traits are inherent in an individual at birth, many other aspects of development particularly that of the growth of a person’s character and personality must be learned through experiences and role models. The personality is the pattern of characteristics that make an individual unique, and also characterizes the person’s tendencies for certain types of behaviors and responses to outside stimuli.
Research indicates that human personality can be described using just five ______.|traits|Psychologists call this The Big Five and they are: extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness.
When discussing personality traits, ___________ refers to emotional instability.|neuroticism|People who rate high in neuroticism are likely to be insecure, subject to frequent mood swings, and prone to worry.  Those who are low in neuroticism are the opposite, they are confident, calm and experience few mood swings.
When discussing personality traits, ____________ refers to how outgoing a person is.|extroversion|An extrovert is fun loving, sociable, and active.  Meanwhile, someone who rates low in extroversion is passive and avoids social contact.
In development research, nature is the __________ component of an organism’s development.|hereditary|The nature of a person can include physical, mental, and emotional traits. For example, Ernest Hemingway inherited mental illness from his father and grandfather.
In developmental research, the environmental component of an organism’s development is known as _______.|nurture|Nurture can relate to the care given to a child during his upbringing. For example, if a child was raised with funny parents who were loving, the child will likely grow up to have a positive view of the world.
Sensory deprivation studies are done in developmental psychology research to try to determine what effect the ___________ has on development.|environment|The whole nature vs. nurture debate is the question of what kind of role the environment plays in our development, and how much of our development is genetically determined.  Sensory deprivation experiments are done to try to find some answers in this debate of nature vs. nurture.
People learn intelligence by adding experience to _________.|potential|In other words, once we learn to develop meaning from various experiences and draw relationships between experiences, as well as making associations between them, we then become more aware of the world around us, and are better prepared to solve problems, analyze information, and witness correlations.
______ development is that which progresses steadily and continuously as a straight line would. In this process, each development is dependent upon those that came before.|Linear|This kind of development relies on building blocks. In education, teachers refer to this strategy of teaching as building upon prior knowledge. Example: You must first learn how to bait a hook before you can catch any fish.
As a child grows into adolescence, and into adulthood, most learn from their role models and their environment to satisfy the expectations of the _______ in which they live. These expectations are known as cultural norms.|society|A culture is a society in which people are raised with a specific set of common beliefs and ideas, mores, and often share a common language and religion.
A ____________ is the way an individual perceives him/herself.|self-concept|Self concept refers to a mental representation capturing one’s views and beliefs about oneself, but not all aspects of an individual can be viewed in its entirety as a result of the self-concept. This is really due to the subjectivity of experiencing one’s own feelings and actions from a limited perception.
A _____________ task is a specific learning that an individual needs at a certain age in order to achieve cultural approval and functional success appropriate to his/her age.|developmental|The developmental tasks are followed as a part of cultural norms by most within a society. It seems that cultural pressures push people to prepare for the next stage in life, and develop within many people a desire to study, work, and socialize with regularity and commitment to ensure advancement to the next stage of maturity within one’s life.
A critical period typically indicates a time in a person’s life when a ______ is in development.|crisis|Critical periods affect both children and adults, and can include normal stresses, as well as the traumas of death, disease, and deprivation of love. Critical periods also reference age-stages where an individual may be the most susceptible to a particular ailment or a failure to mature appropriately. For example, a child between the ages of six to eighteen is within their critical period for developing concepts regarding love and attachments, which function as the foundation for socialization.
Environmental theories are those theories that aim to explain or predict behavior based primarily on a person’s ________ and past experience, and not placing as much emphasis on genetics.|learning|Environmental theories often look at a person’s life to determine background experiences including family relationships, education, and community to determine some basic awareness of the environment in which the person was raised. The environment often indicates the kinds of influences surrounding a person’s development, and can be one of many predictors in his/her later development.
According to Abraham ______'s hierarchy of needs, at the top of the pyramid is self-actualization.|Maslow|By self-actualization, he meant the need to reach one's unique potential to the fullest.
The theory that emphasizes the interaction between the ___________ and a person’s genetic heritage is known as epigenetic.|environment|Epigenetic theories emphasize nature as well as nurture.
A ______ is a system of rules or assumptions used to predict or explain phenomena.|theory|Theories help researchers narrow down the possibilities of cause and effect situations, among many other researched topics.
Erikson proposed that there were eight stages of psycho-social development, four of which occur during childhood.  They are 1.) Trust vs. mistrust, 2.) Autonomy vs. shame and doubt, 3.) Initiative vs. guilt, 4.) ________ vs. Inferiority. |Industry|Erikson defined eight stages, and a crisis that is associated with each stage. The Industry (or Competence) vs. Inferiority stage deals with whether the child develops a sense of confidence in intellectual and social skills or develops a sense of failure and lack of confidence. 
________ Formation was studied by Erik Erikson, who constructed the major task of adolescence as identity vs. identity diffusion. |Identity|It’s defined by the question Who am I uniquely? (likes, dislikes, beliefs, traits, interests, identifications).
According to Erikson’s  eight stages of human development, the crisis experienced in the adolescent stage is ________.|identity|Erik Erikson's adolescence stage lasts from Age 12 to 18, and during this time humans deal with the Identity Crisis--Who am I? Erikson considered this the single most significant conflict a person must face. 
Erik Erikson defined eight stages of human development. The second stage involves the crisis of ________ (independence) vs. Doubt. |Autonomy|Autonomy versus Doubt (or Shame) is Erikson's second stage. It marks the beginning of self-control and self-confidence.
In _______’s theory of Basic Trust vs. mistrust (period of time in infancy), the parents must maintain an adequate environment-supportive, nurturing, and loving, so that the child will develop basic trust.|Erikson|Erikson believed that the lack of positive emotional stimulation for infants would result in the development of a mistrustful nature for the child. He viewed parents as the first role models for children, which is where children derive a sense of loving, safety, and belonging, without which, the child is unable to mature openly on an emotional level causing distrust or mistrust.
Behaviorism is a type of psychology that was developed by John Watson, and was based on an objective system, which was done through the ___________ of repeated patterns in behavior that would explain a person’s thinking process and reaction to stimuli.|observation|Behaviorism is essentially the observation of repeated patterns of behavior of an individual. A therapist or psychologist trained in this type of psychology is then able to take all the similar response patterns and determine an overview of the behaviors witnessed in an individual.
Traditional behaviorists believe that ________ plays the most important role in determining future development.|learning|Behaviorists, such as Pavlov, believed that learning took place as a result of conditioning, or the repeated presence of a stimulus to determine the learned response to the object. Example: Pavlov repeatedly rang a bell when he provided his dogs with their food. After some time with this study, Pavlov would simply ring the bell, and the dogs would arrive and wait to be fed because they had learned to associate the ringing of the bell with feeding time. Thus, a conditioned stimulus was the key to learning.
Classical ____________ is an experimental procedure in which a stimulus that normally evokes a given reflex is continually associated with a stimulus that does not usually evoke that reflex, with the result that the new stimulus will eventually evoke the reflex when presented by itself.|conditioning|Classical conditioning is best represented by the process of training/learning experienced by Pavlov’s dogs.  Pavlov would ring a bell every time he brought them some food, and eventually, the dogs would salivate whenever he rang the bell, whether he brought food or not.  That is an example of classical conditioning--associating a reflex (salivating) with a stimulus (bell ringing) that it normally is not associated with.
The law of effect is _________’s principle that responses associated with pleasant consequences tend to be repeated, while those associated with discomforting consequences tend to be eliminated.|Thorndike|This effect is known as one of the cornerstones of learning. An individual’s responses are either changed or maintained depending on the consequences that follow a response. Example: A child that pets a dog that responds to the child with licks and a wagging tail will likely continue to pet dogs and enjoy them. However, if the child later pets a dog that barks loudly and scares the child, or the dog bites the child, the child will likely develop some hesitation or fear of that dog, and perhaps all dogs.
Social learning is defined as the process of learning by _________ the actions of other people.|observing|Example: If a child witnesses her older brother earn good grades and receive praise from their parents, she may learn through this social learning process that she should work hard to make good grades as well to earn her parents praise, also.
In social learning theory, anyone who demonstrates a behavior that other people observe are known as ______.|models|A model is a role model in a sense. The model displays certain actions and characteristics within a situation that others observe and often imitate. This behavior is also known as mirroring.
Behavior modification is a set of procedures for changing human behavior, especially by using behavior _______.|therapy|Behavior modification is used by psychologists to redirect or reshape the behavior patterns of people. Through the prediction of the person’s responses, the psychologist is able to manipulate the outside forces to help create new responses for the individual.
The study of human and animal behavior from a __________ point of view, characterized by the study of animals in their natural environments is known as ethology.|biological|Ethology is a more popular study in Europe than in the U.S., and it focuses on researching inherited behavior through family genetics and lineage.
The _________ theory emphasizes the ability to think in an internal and conscious manner.|cognitive|This theory stresses the importance of an individual’s consideration of past experiences and the use of that information to make good decisions in present and future situations using previously acquired knowledge.
______ was initially trained as a biologist and naturalist, and later became a psychologist, and was known best for his studies in ethology during his early career.|Piaget|Jean Piaget is one of the most notable researchers in psychology and was a follower in the cognitive theory of development.
_____________ describes classrooms where students with disabilities and students who do not have disabilities are together.|Mainstreaming|Mainstreaming involves allowing disabled students study in normal classrooms with nondisabled students.  Disabled students are first evaluated to determine if they can meet the expectations for such a setting.
During cognitive growth, __________ is apparent when a person or thing changes to fit with its surroundings.|adaptation|This was a term used by Piaget to describe the ability of a person or thing to adjust and best match the environment, especially when it comes to way of thinking.  There are two ways in which a person adapts his/her thinking--assimilation and accommodation.
Assimilation is Piaget’s term for the ability to take in information and perceptions that are __________ with the person’s current understanding of the world.|compatible|Assimilation involves incorporating new information into previously existing thinking structures or schema (e.g., a child encounters a Dalmatian for the first time and incorporates Dalmatians into her existing schema for dogs).
Piaget’s term for the process in which people adjust or change their understanding to incorporate aspects of an experience not currently represented in the cognitive structure is known as _____________.|accommodation|Accommodation involves the formation of new mental structures or schema when new information does not fit into existing structures (e.g., a child encounters a skunk for the first time and learns that it is different from dogs and cats. She must create new representation for skunks).
___________ is a term used by Piaget to describe a hypothetical innate drive that forces a person to actively pursue cognitive adaptation. In this view, children have a natural inclination toward cognitive development.|Equilibrium|It is likely that this driving force has external factors like the expectations of parents, teachers, and peers to learn, understand, and communicate new ideas with them.
Children seem to be born with a particular ___________, which over the course of a lifetime becomes an adult personality.|temperament|An adult's personality has some kind of biological basis in the temperament he was born with as a child.  However, the environment he grows up in plays a huge role in shaping that temperament into his personality as an adult.
The ____________ approach to research involves repeated measurements obtained from the same subject over time.|longitudinal|Longitudinal studies are long-term approaches to research to obtain a consistent amount of similar information over a period of years in order to establish a firm basis for consistency. 
Probabilistic __________ is literally the direction in which growth will probably go. In cognitive development theory, the term is used to describe the stages of cognitive development--representing only what typically occurs during the development of most individuals, but not necessarily in the development of all individuals.|epigenesis|Example: Most kindergarten children learn their ABC’s before first grade, but not every single student does. This is the likelihood we recognize, but it is not definitive with all people.
A __________ pyramid is a graphic depiction of the number of individuals within given age ranges.|population|Each age range is stacked from the youngest to oldest; in the normal population, the graph typically forms a pyramid shape.
Empirical evidence is the information collected that is based solely on ___________ or objective observations.|experiments|
In a cross-_________ approach to research, a number of subjects of different ages are tested or observed at one given time.|sectional|This approach attempts to find consistency among a large number of people to find the most common patterns among the group of people.
Any group of people born at the same ____ is called a cohort.|time|A cohort is a generational group as defined in statistics, for example the cohort of people aged 30 to 39...  Because cohorts are born at approximately the same time, they are exposed to similar cultural and historical experiences.
An __________ is a test made to demonstrate the validity of some hypothesis or to determine the predictability of a theory. Variables are manipulated during the test. Any changes are contrasted with those of a control that has not been exposed to the variables of interest.|experiment|Experiments are, in essence, an opportunity to use a series of tests to determine whether or not a researcher’s beliefs or opinions about a certain thing are true or false.
The ____ score is the average score.|mean|The mean is another word for the average. The mean score is very important when dealing with norm-referenced tests, because a student's score is compared to the mean score of the rest of the class.
The ______ is a measure of central tendency.|median|Median is the value of a set of numbers that divides it exactly in half. There are as many scores above the median as below it. For example, in the following set of numbers: 1, 4, 1, 7, 9... 4 is the median, because if you arranged the numbers in order, 4 would be the middle number. 
The ____ is the most frequently occurring value in a set or distribution of scores.|mode|Given the following set of numbers: 1, 4, 1, 7, 9... the mode would be 1, because that occurs more than any other number in the group. 
Hierarchy of motives is a theory developed by Abraham ______ in which more basic needs must be met first before needs of a higher order can come into play.|Maslow|Also called the hierarchy of needs, this hierarchy starts with physiological needs at the bottom, all the way up to self-actualization needs at the top.  Needs at the bottom must be fulfilled before needs at the top become a source of motivation--for example, the desire to have a better education (self-actualization) is not likely to motivate you when you are starving to death (physiological needs).
A time-___ design is a research design that measures the characteristics and behaviors of groups of people in the same age group for similarities and differences.|lag|The Time-lag design allows researchers to note the process of human development in a general way by studying the physical and mental similarities of people within the same age range. This allows researchers to make generalizations about the rate at which an average person should develop and mature. 
Within the process of testing and research there are certain elements of the process that are arranged in a particular way so that the observer is able to observe the effects of a manipulated variable on its subjects. The arranged __________ within research are known as controls.|conditions|The control simply allows the observer to focus on one particular area of the research and the subject’s response to the control. 
The longitudinal method of research involves studying the same __________s at different points in their lives.|individual|Longitudinal studies are long-term studies that require a great deal of money and time.  They allow researchers to study development as it occurs over time.  This is different from cross-sectional studies, where different groups of people varying in age are studied.  For example, to study development in a person as they age from 5 to 20 years old, a cross-sectional study might just take a group of people who are 5, a group of people who are 10, another group that's 15, etc..  On the other hand, a longitudinal study would study one group of people for 15 years. 
A correlation is defined as the relationship between two _________.|variables|For example, there is a strong correlation between height and weight. The taller a person, the heavier he tends to be. Correlations are used when researchers are unable to conduct experiments, and so they are often forced to rely upon the findings of correlational data.
In an experiment, the independent variable is the _____.|cause|The independent variable is the cause, the dependent variable is what is affected.  For example, if you are doing tests where you give a person different amounts of caffeine to see how it affects their energy level, then the caffeine is the cause (the independent variable), and the person's energy level is the dependent variable--it is affected by manipulating the caffeine. 
An intensive study of a single case, or individual, with all available data, test results, and opinions about that individual is known as a ____ study.|case|Case studies are usually done in more depth than studies done on groups of individuals. A case study may follow the progress of an individual for months or even years to gather the most data possible regarding the individual’s patterns, growth, and maturation. 
In an experiment on kittens, scientists sutured shut one eye in some of the kittens in a litter shortly after they were born.  Two months later, they would open the sutured eye, and that eye would be functionally blind for the rest of their life, while the other eye would be fine.  This is because there is a critical period for ______ development.|vision|In the kittens, there was nothing physically wrong with that one eye, but this is an example of a critical period.  A critical period is a time window within which the brain must experience certain things, or certain skills can never be developed.  To see out of an eye, a kitten must be able to use that eye within the first couple of months after birth; to fly, a bird has to be allowed to use its wings to fly within a certain period of time, or it will never be able to learn. 
In observational research, the researcher’s focus is on watching the patterns of the subject, as well as the subject’s responses to surrounding _______.|stimuli|Observational research is used to gather data about the subject while in a specific situation or environment to determine certain patterns of behaviors, responses to stimuli, and other exposed characteristics.  Quite often, observational research involves observing the subject in a natural environment, instead of a lab environment--for example, a child playing during recess. 
A _________ is an elimination of a complex emotion by bringing it to consciousness and allowing it to be expressed.|catharsis|It is also any emotional release resulting from a buildup of internal tensions. This practice is used within psychoanalytic theory. 
The degree of agreement or disagreement between two or more observers who make simultaneous observations of a single event is known as _____________ reliability.|interobserver|Two people could see the same event and come away with different observations.  This practice attempts to gather a general consensus from those observing the same event to develop some level of clarity. 
___________ is the repetition of an experiment to enhance the reliability of the results.|Replication|Replication provides researchers an opportunity to observe the subject’s responses to the constant presence of a controlled variable.
An extension is an enlargement, increase, or extension of initial ________.|research|An extension allows the researchers prolonged time with an experiment or observation to collect additional information (data) and develop a more definitive view of the research. 
A relatively informal naturalistic observation of an infant’s routines and behaviors is known as a baby _________.|biography|The baby biography is a tool that is based on observation and data collection to determine the skills and advancement of an infant for its age to determine development. 
The ______ is a method of collecting data through the use of interviews and questionnaires.|survey|Surveys are typically used to collect information from groups of people, which can be large or small in size. This process allows researchers to find an average number of people with similar responses to certain subjects or questions. 
Conception, or _____________, occurs when a father’s sperm cell joins with a mother’s egg cell.|fertilization|The female egg (ovum) is released by the female and the male sperm penetrates the egg resulting in the creation of a zygote (fertilized egg). 
The period of the ______ lasts from the time of the zygote’s attachment to the uterine wall until the first occurrence of bone development.|embryo|
The process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that reduces the number of chromosomes in reproductive cells, leading to the production of gametes is known as _______.|meiosis|Sperm and egg cells have half the number of chromosomes as body cells.  Without the process of meiosis, sperm and egg cells would have the same number of chromosomes as body cells, and when joined the chromosomes in each cell would be doubled. 
There are 46 ___________ in normal human cells (non-sex cells).|chromosomes|There are 46 chromosomes, or in other words, 23 pairs of chromosomes.  The sex cells, on the other hand, only have 23 chromosomes--that way, when the male and female sex cells join together, they form 46 chromosomes.
An ________ is any chromosome that is not a sex chromosome.|autosome|Autosomes can be liver cells, brain cells, tissue cells, as long as they do not relate to reproduction.
Sex ___________ in humans are those that are responsible for producing the sex of a child.|chromosomes|Sex chromosome are either X or Y. Two X’s result in the birth of a girl and an X and a Y result in a boy. 
There are many outside influences that can injure an unborn child. Substances that are taken into the system that can produce fetal _____________ are known as teratogens.|abnormalities|Teratogens include smoking, alcohol consumptions, and drug use, and can have severe and harmful effects on a fetus. Smoking can cause low birth rate, asthma, and stillbirth in newborns. Alcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which harms the child’s development both mentally and physically.
A _______ in genetics is an organism that carries a particular trait in its genes and, while not expressing the trait itself, is able to pass on the trait to its offspring.|carrier|Example: A mother could be the carrier of hemophilia and not show signs of the illness, but her son could be born with active hemophilia.  Another example, a mother may be brown eyed but be the carrier of the blue eyed trait, and pass that trait down to her son. 
_____________ is a disease of humans, dogs, cats, and certain other mammals, caused by parasitic microorganisms that affect the nervous system.|Toxoplasmosis|This disorder is especially damaging to an embryo or fetus.
A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that alcohol use by pregnant women can result in birth defects in unborn children. Characteristic birth defects noted in the children of some women who consume alcohol during their pregnancies is known as _____ alcohol syndrome. |fetal|Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can have disastrous consequences for the developing fetus. Low birth weight, facial abnormalities, and heart problems are often seen in infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent estimates indicate that the full expression of this syndrome occurs at a rate of between 1 and 3 per 1000 births. 
_______ while pregnant can result in defects in the developing child known as fetal tobacco syndrome.|Smoking|Babies with fetal tobacco syndrome may have facial abnormities, mental retardation, heart defects, and a host of other problems. 
Approximately one percent of babies are born with symptoms of ______ (oxygen deprivation).|anoxia|Anoxia is a potentially serious birth complication that can cause brain damage and other defects.  It's usually caused when the umbilical cord becomes tangled or constricted during childbirth.
___ or AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease that causes the human immune system to fail, and is lethal in most cases.|HIV|HIV or AIDS (Human Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). The virus may enter the bloodstream of the unborn infant of an infected mother by crossing the placental barrier. Babies who are born with HIV/AIDS often die within infancy or early childhood.
There are many perinatal factors that can adversely affect a newborn. ____ syndrome is a congenital disorder that causes mild to severe mental retardation, slow physical development, and has characteristic physical features.|Down|Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome and occurs roughly in 1 out of every 1,000 births. People with Down syndrome are more susceptible to childhood illness, leukemia, and respiratory and heart problems. 
Motor development is considered a function of __________--parental involvement has little to do with its development.|maturation|Motor development is a biologically-based process.  Any efforts by parents to specially train an infant in its motor development has little effect in the long-term, because motor development depends on an individual's own rate of biological maturation.
A _________ is the observable characteristics of an organism due to inheritance.|phenotype|Example: A daughter may have the same nose shape and eye color as her father, resembling his appearance greatly.  The nose shape is a phenotype--it is the visible reflection of some kind of gene that was inherited.
A sex-linked disorder is a __________ disorder controlled by a gene carried on the sex-determining chromosome.|hereditary|An example of a sex-linked disorder is color blindness. This only affects boys. 
The control or determination of more than one characteristic or function by a ______ gene is known as pleiotropy.|single|Most genes affect only one characteristic or function.  Pleiotropy refers to a single gene controlling multiple characteristics.  An example of this is Marfan’s syndrome where the disease causes a weakened aorta, deformed bone structure, and poor vision.
Herpes is a disease that can be passed from mother to newborn in the birthing process. This disease can attack the skin or mucous membranes. It is often difficult to treat, and can harm an infant who is born to a mother in an ______ stage of the disease as it passes through the birth canal.|active|The disease is not always evident even in its active stages, so women who are aware of the disease often undergo a cesarean-section to deliver the child from their stomach, rather than through a vaginal delivery.
Maturation refers to the processes of __________ development of bodily mechanisms that do the behaving.|biological|In developmental psychology, maturity refers to changes in a person that are pre-programmed, that occur naturally, not from learning or the environment.  Maturation occurs when internal clocks signal to the body certain developments should occur. An example of maturation can be seen in the process of puberty where the child begins to develop sexually, and will change typically in height and weight. 
Motor ___________ is largely a function of maturation; a result of nature rather than nurture.|development|Just as individual babies differ, so does the rate of an individual’s motor development. Some children develop quickly, while others are slower to mature. It is noted that parental involvement has little to do with the timeliness of motor development because it is a biologically-based process. 
The visual cliff is a device that was designed to test a child’s _____ perception.|depth|The visual cliff is a prop used in research to determine a child’s recognition of the drop-off angle on a cliff-like structure, which determines their motor skill advancement, and determines the child’s depth perception. 
A cross-_____ transfer is the recognition of an object as familiar when perceived with a sense other than that previously exposed to the object.|modal|The cross-modal transfer uses the senses to help a person to determine an object in a new way. Example: If you were to take a lemon and ask a person to taste it, and then present the lemon to a person whose eyes are shut, and then ask them to smell it, it is likely the person can determine the presence of a lemon from both their sense of taste and their sense of smell.
Olfaction is the sense of _____, and is well-developed within a newborn.|smell|Researchers have found that babies’ keen sense of smell is equal to that of an adult’s. Babies have been found to respond negatively to unpleasant odors, and positively respond to pleasant odors, which indicates the full maturity of the olfactory sense at birth.
There are four basic tastes that babies will respond to, which are similar to that of adult responses. The tastes are _____, salty, bitter, and sour.|sweet|Like a newborn’s sense of smell, infants also have a fully developed sense of taste.
The memory associated with recall of muscular or glandular responses that have been conditioned are known as __________ memories and are acquired slowly with practice.|procedural|This type of memory is required to recall the skills necessary for object manipulation and learned physical activity. It is sometimes called a skill or motor memory. For instance, a child may need to practice repeatedly to remember how to fit shapes into a shape box. It is through regular attempts that the child begins to memorize the steps that led to success.
The ___________ memory is associated with cognitive skills that are not directly related to muscular or glandular responses such as breathing. The complete memory may be acquired through a single exposure, but practice is usually needed to make the information remain usable.|declarative|The declarative memory is that part of the learning process which is used to recall factual information, and is often referred to as fact memory. Example: The declarative memory is used to remember classmate’s names, to remember the words of a song, or even the characters in a favorite book. The more a person is exposed to the information the greater the retention will be. 
When a child stops responding to an ever-present or frequent stimulus it is known as ___________.|habituation|Example: When a child first encounters a cat or dog, he/she may be frightened or curious of the animal, but as time goes by and the child has had repeated encounters with the animal, he/she is likely to become habituated, and not pay attention to the animal. 
Children who are not given adequate amounts of healthy foods can suffer from ____________ which can cause physical, mental, and emotional traumas.|malnutrition|Malnutrition is common in third world countries where food is scarce, and nutritious food is even harder to access. However, malnutrition can occur when children fail to receive food with enough vitamins and minerals to keep them healthy. 
DNA is a unique ________, which is sometimes called the essence of life.|molecule|DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Every living plant or animal contains DNA in every cell of its being. The body is made up of approximately 60 trillion cells, all of which contain DNA. DNA is the substance that enables cells to copy themselves. A child is made up of DNA cells from both his mother and father, and therefore researchers are able to determine the biology and heritage of a child through DNA sampling.
A ____ is the smallest functional unit for the transmission of a hereditary trait; it is a section of the genetic code of a living thing.|gene|Genes are present within all living things and they function as a carrier of biological patterns from both parents to a child. Such patterns may include facial features, height, and body type.
Genetic ___________ is any technique by which genes are artificially manipulated, built, replaced, or altered outside of normal breeding.|engineering|Example: Genetic engineering allows researchers and scientists to place genes from a rat and place it into a mouse causing the mouse to become abnormally large. The point of this process is to create specific characteristics that may not normally be present in a person or thing.
Parallel play is where children play _____________ beside other children but not with them.|independently|Children engaged in parallel play may play close together and with similar toys, but they do not interact. 
______'s law explains the fundamental laws that explain genetic inheritance.|Mendel|Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) was an Austrian Monk who spent years cross-breeding peas. He spent years observing and recording his experiments and learned some important concepts about simple inheritance, which links an offspring to both parents.
An ______ is any group of possible mutational forms of a gene.|allele|An allele is a spot on a chromosome for a particular trait. Each chromosome is part of a pair, so the allele, or trait, is present in the same spot on the pair of chromosomes.
In genetics, the expression of the _______________ controlled by one of a pair of genes regulating a given trait in an organism, and the suppression of the characteristics controlled by the other is known as dominance.|characteristics|A dominant gene may come from one or both parents, and will usually result in the same genetic trait with their offspring. For example, brown hair is a dominant gene trait, and most children with brown haired parents also have brown hair, unless both parents pass down a recessive gene.
A _________ gene is one that is not expressed when it is paired with a dominant gene.|recessive|For any trait a person has, he has two genes which together determine that trait, one gene from each parent.  For example, if a child has a brown eyed father and a blue-eyed mother, he may receive a brown eyed gene from the father, and a blue eyed gene from the mother.  In that case, he would be brown eyed, because the gene for brown eyes is dominant, and the gene for blue eyes is recessive.  To have blue eyes, which is recessive, he would have to have the blue eyed gene from both parents--not just one. 
During _______ the most significant form of maturation is sexual.|puberty|Sexual maturation occurs at different ages with adolescents, but has an average around the age of 13 years of age. The onset of puberty brings on changes in hormone levels which creates bodily changes within both genders, and is a time when both sexes are physically able to reproduce. 
During ______ maturation, adolescent girls will begin to menstruate, which is the process that allows them to become pregnant.|sexual|Menstruation is a sloughing away of the lining of the cervical wall, as well as a cycle regulator for an egg to be released each month for the possible presence of a male sperm to fertilize it and create a child. 
Development follows two patterns: the _____________ principle and the proximodistal principle.|cephalocaudal|The two principles are Cephalocaudal and Proximodistal.  The Cephalocaudal principle says that growth progresses from head to foot, and the proximodistal principle states that development proceeds from near to far--outward from the central axis of the body toward the extremities. 
A moratorium is a time in which an __________ is searching for his or her identity.|adolescent|Moratorium is literally the suspension of a planned activity, or the delay in performance or obligation. Adolescents learn to socialize through their teenage years, and as a result they begin to create an image of themselves through social, academic, and family encounters. 
The _________ system’s glands and hormones are controlled by both the brain and the autonomic nervous system.|endocrine|Hormones are a variety of chemical compounds, which are secreted by the endocrine glands, and carried through the bloodstream. 
The spinal cord is a massive collection of _______ within the spine that looks rather like a section of rope or a thick cord.|neurons|The spinal cord is surrounded and protected by the hard bone and cartilage of the vertebrae.
The ______ cord has two major functions; the first is to rapidly transmit neural impulses to the brain.|spinal|Whenever sensory messages originate below the neck and go to the brain, they do so through the spinal cord. 
The second major function of the spinal cord is its involvement in the spinal ________.|reflexes|These are very simple automatic behaviors that occur without the conscious, voluntary actions of the brain. 
The most important of our endocrine glands is the _________ gland.|pituitary|It is often referred to as the master gland, reflecting the fact that it directly controls the activity of many other glands in the system. The pituitary is nestled just under the brain.  Another reason this gland is so important is the massive amounts and varieties of hormones that it secretes. 
One of the most significant advances in technology that has aided the study of the brain was the development of the _________ for stimulating and/or recording the activity of individual cells.|electrode|Electrodes are very fine wires that can be eased into certain areas of the brain, and once in position, the electrode can be used to deliver a mild electric current to stimulate the brain. 
Just above the spinal cord, at the very base of the brain, there are ___ important structures that together form what is called the brain stem.|two|
The very ______ structure is the medulla.|lowest|The medulla acts like the spinal cord in that its major functions involve involuntary reflexes.
_____________ is the study of the relationships between the physical attributes of stimuli and the psychological experiences that they produce.  It is the oldest subfield in psychology.|Psychophysics|The two attempts of psychophysics are: to assess sensitivity of one’s senses, and on a theoretical level provide a means relating the physical outside world to that of the inner psychological world.
The absolute _________ is the physical intensity of a stimulus that a subject reports detecting 50 percent of the time.|threshold|This sort of result occurs for all senses, and the results would have the same general result with the testing of sound, smell, touch or taste.  An example of an approximate absolute threshold for smell is one drop of perfume in a 3 bedroom apartment. 
A __________ threshold is defined as the minimal difference between stimulus attributes that can be detected.|difference|
________________ theory takes the position that stimulus detection involves a decision-making process of separating a signal from background noise.|Signal detection|This occurs when one needs to judge whether or not a stimulus has been presented.  That judgment is made in the context of a shifting background noise created by other stimuli in the environment and by one’s own nervous system activity. 
Becoming __________ to a sound, a sight, an object, or some other kind of stimulus is known as habituation.|accustomed|Habituation occurs when we learn not to respond to repeated occurrences of a stimulus.  For example, take off your watch and place it on your other wrist.  Does it now feel funny or out of place?  Shouldn't it feel the same on either wrist?  It feels strange because you became habituated to the feeling of a watch on one wrist.
Light travels in the form of waves of energy, and differences in intensity of light correspond to differences in the wave _________ of light.|amplitude|The amplitude of a wave is represented by its height, and the amplitude of a light wave is the representation of a light’s physical intensity. 
__________ is the psychological experience of intensity of light.|Brightness|The difference between a dim light and a bright light is due to the difference in wave amplitude, but we don't actually see the difference in amplitude, what we see is a difference in brightness.
A second characteristic of waves is __________, which is the distance between any point in a wave and the corresponding point on the next cycle-the distance from peak to peak.|wavelength|
Pure light is called _____________ because it is made up of light waves of all one length or hue.|monochromatic|Example: A monochromatic color would be bright red without any shades of other colors or hues present. 
The ________ purity of a light source determines the psychological characteristic that is known as saturation.|physical|Pure, monochromatic lights are the most highly saturated; their hue is rich and obvious. As more and more different wavelengths get mixed into a light, it becomes lower and lower in saturation-and it starts to look pale and washed out.
Visual _________ refers to the tendency for objects to look the same to us despite fluctuations in sensory input.|constancy|There are three types of visual constancy--color constancy, size constancy, and shape constancy.  Size constancy refers to the fact that an object looks the same as we move further away from it--whether it is one foot away, or five feet away, a bowl of cereal looks the same. 
_________ is the sense of smell.|Olfaction|
Maximum __________ development takes place between the ages of three and a half and seven years of age.|perceptual|A child perceives differently from an adult, and although utilizing the same sense of sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, they possess different approaches to processing the information.
The four stages of development include the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operations stage, and the ______ operations stage.|formal|These are the four stages of cognitive development as described by Jean Piaget. 
At birth, the _____ developed part of an infant's central nervous system is its cerebral cortex.|least|At birth, parts such as the brain stem and spinal cord, which control involuntary actions and reflexes are some of the most developed parts of an infant's central nervous system (CNS).  The cerebral cortex, which is responsible for learning, thinking, reading, and problem solving, is the least developed part of an infant's CNS. 
In the ____________ stage, children discover by sensing and by doing.|sensorimotor|This stage includes causality, by which each child gradually comes to know that some events have knowable causes and that some behaviors cause predictable reactions.
By the end of the sensorimotor experience, children have established that although physical objects may not be present, they still exist, and will at times await their reappearance. This awareness is called object __________.|permanence|A child that has not developed object permanence will forget about a ball as soon as he cannot see it, because as soon as the ball leaves his sight, it does not exist for him--the object does not have permanence. 
In the visual _____ experiment, a child's depth perception is tested.|cliff|Between three and five months of age, an infants' ability to tell the distances of various objects and to experience the world three-dimensionally undergoes a huge development.  In the visual cliff experiment, a child who has developed depth perception will be reluctant to cross what looks like a cliff, even though their hands tell them that there is a solid glass surface.
Light first enters the eye through the ______.|cornea|The cornea is the tough, round, virtually transparent outer shell of the eye. 
Having passed through the cornea, light then travels through the _____, which is an opening in the iris.|pupil|The iris is the part of the eye which is pigmented or colored. 
________ is our perception of the frequency and wavelength of sound, and involves both the mind and our sense organ.|Audition|Audition is the act of hearing.
Loudness is a psychological characteristic which is measured by people, not instruments. The _______ scale of sound intensity has been constructed so that it reflects perceived loudness in humans.|decibel|
A ________ time in an organism’s development when certain experiences have an effect, and after which the effect can no longer be obtained through exposure to experience is known as a critical period.|specific|A critical period is the window of time in an individual’s life where they must learn certain abilities or else they will lose the opportunity to acquire that particular behavior. 
Another period is known as a sensitive period in which a particular organism is ____ sensitive to the effects of the stimuli.|most|During the sensitive period children may develop negative behaviors if they are misguided. For example, research shows that the ages between 8 and 10 years of age are the most sensitive for children to be exposed to violence. They have found a tendency for children of this age group to become more violent in later years as a result of over exposure to violence during this sensitive period. 
Sensory deprivation can include the removal of light, sound, and may include _________ which usually results in a negative response from the individual encountering the losses.|isolation|Sensory deprivation can lead to hallucinations, physical and mental illnesses, stunted emotional and mental growth, and many other ailments. Sensory deprivation can affect both children and adults.
_____________ age measures a child's development in terms of age norms.|Developmental|For instance, if a 5 year old took an intelligence test and scored high, it might be determined that his developmental age is 7 years old--in other words, he is only five years of age, but his intelligence is at the level of an average 7 year old.
______’s Theory of Cognitive Development discusses the development of schemas.|Piaget|This is the approach people take to organizing the world into an interrelated network of schemas by which they can categorize and identify people and things for recognition and further understanding.
Schemas are _________ mental representations of the world.|organized|Schemas assist children, and others, to categorize information and develop subgroups for linking past knowledge with that learned in the future for the process of distinction.
One key concept of Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development is accommodation --altering your way of ________ in response to new information.|thinking|Accommodation is what happens when a person must change their current way of viewing the world to respond to a situation.  For example, if a boy believes that all rocks sink in water, then sees some volcanic rock floating on water, he will adjust his thinking to believe that most rocks sink.  This process is accommodation.
Accommodation involves ________ and revising existing schemas in the face of new experiences or new information.|changing|Piaget proposed that children assimilate new ideas into existing schemas and modify or accommodate the old ones by which they progress through the four identifiable stages of development.
In the secondary circular reactions substage of Piaget's sensorimotor stage, infants' behavior expands from being centered on their own bodies to ___________ with their environment.|interacting|An example of an infant in the secondary circular reactions stage is when the infant hits a toy and it makes a jingling sound, so the infant continues to hit the toy.  He's not waving his hand just for the sake of waving it, he's waving it so that he can hear the jingling sound.
The preoperational stage is a time where the child’s thinking is ____-centered.|self|It is during this stage that the child comes to understand that he/she is an independent and separate person in the world.
According to Jean Piaget, one major characteristic of the pre-___________ stage is egocentrism, where children consider their own point of view to be the only possible one.|operational|In the preoperational stage, children are egocentric.  Piaget does not mean the child is self-serving or selfish, rather, the child is incapable of seeing things from another person's point of view.  For example, a child may have just taken a nap and be full of energy and want to play, and will believe that the mother feels the same way--he can't imagine that the mother could be tired while he is full of energy.
The two periods of _______ growth are from birth to age three, and then later during the adolescent growth spurt.|fastest|During those two periods of time--the first couple of years after birth, and during adolescence--growth is fastest.  In comparison, the years between these two growth spurts are moderately slow.
In the ________ operational stage, children begin to develop many concepts and show that they can manipulate those concepts.|concrete|It is in this period that we may say that rule-governed behavior begins.  The concrete, observable objects of the child’s world can be classified, ranked, ordered, or separated into one or more categories.
____________ involves the cognitive awareness that changing the form or the appearance of something does not necessarily change what it is.|Conservation|Understanding conservation signals the beginning of the concrete operational stage. Example: Let's say you're dealing with a child who does not grasp the concept of conservation.  If you show him two equally sized balls of clay, and then flatten one of the balls into a pancake, he might say there is more clay in the pancake, even though the amount of clay never changed.
A key characteristic of the concrete operations stage of Piaget's theory is that the child understands reversibility--he can think ________ from the end to the beginning.|backward|In the concrete operations stage, a child understands Reversibility, Conservation, and is able to classify things.  Before a child reaches this stage, he cannot think about events in reverse.
The logical manipulation of ________, symbolic concepts does not appear until the last of Piaget’s stages- formal operations.|abstract|The key to this stage, usually begun at adolescence, is abstract, symbolic reasoning. Example: A twelve year old child may be able to read a story and understand the moral immediately, yet a seven year old may read the same story but not discern the principle or moral point of the book.
According to Piaget, it isn't until a child reaches the formal operations stage that he is capable of ________ thought and discussing things in scientific terms.|abstract|A child must be in the formal operations stage of cognitive development before he can discuss scientific operations and principles such as Newton's laws of motions.
Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who theorized that _________ development proceeds in four genetically determined stages that always follow the same sequential order, and was best known for his groundbreaking work in developmental psychology.|cognitive|Jean Piaget defined four stages of cognitive development, and believed that they always happen in the same order--although different children may go through the stages at different speeds.  The four stages are sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.
Memory is the _________ ability to encode, store, and retrieve information.|cognitive|A person’s memory is what allows them to pull information about specific people, places, events, and much more from their mind. To recall or remember something that has occurred in the past in known as a memory.
________ is the active process of putting information into memory.|Encoding|It is during this stage of gathering and sorting that memories are related and interrelated under subtopics and subcategories based on time, emotion, people involved, and places of event. Example: Encoding treats your mind like a filing cabinet. It groups similar experiences and information together and stores it away based on certain associations that you will make to recall specific information.
_______ is the process of holding the encoded information in memory until the time of retrieval.|Storage|This is the function of your mind acting like the filing cabinet. Information is tagged with keywords and relationships that will allow you to trigger the information quickly for the most part.
The process of ________, removing and using information stored in one’s memory is known as retrieval.|locating|Retrieval allows a person to use past experiences to make new decisions and associations based on information gathered and stored in the past.
A view that states that there is but one memory, but that information can be processed within that memory at different degrees, levels, or depths is known as levels of __________ model of memory.|processing|The depth of memory and processing is quite complex and is dependent upon the information’s emotional impact, value (or level of relevance to your current needs), along with many other storage factors relating to memory.
_______ memory is a type of memory that holds large amounts of information registered at the senses for very brief periods of time.|Sensory|Sensory Memory contains information received immediately from a person's senses into the human brain.  Sensory information is stored for just an instant, and we decide what to process further.  For example, as long as your eyes are open, you have a constant stream of pictures entering your sensory memory, but you don't process it all--most of it you just discard a second or two later.
Once information gets to the sensory memory, it then moves to the _____-term memory.|short|Whether you decide to process it or not, sensory memory lasts only a couple of seconds.  Most sensory memory is discarded, but the sensory experiences which you do decide to process are moved to the short-term memory.  Short-term memory has a limited capacity and typically a brief duration.
Long-term memory is the storage of an _________ of information, and is held for long periods of time.|abundance|The long-term memory storage bank is almost limitless in its capacity to hold information. This means that as an aging person you may still be able to recall very specific information about your family when you were a small child without any hesitation.
___________ rehearsal is a mechanism for processing information into Long-Term memory that involves the meaningful manipulation of the information to be remembered.|Elaborative|In other words, the stored memory needs to be elaborated upon to make sense of the information given. This may be especially true if the memory was of a complicated situation in childhood where the information could not be fully understood.
__________ memory is stored in the long-term memory, and is where associations and skilled patterns of responses are stored.|Procedural|
A more complex memory, which is where vocabulary, simple concepts and rules are stored, is known as ________ memory.|semantic|The semantic memory is a type of long-term memory which is a structured record of facts, concepts and skills that we have acquired.  Things such as a word definition, or the name of the 25th president, would be stored in semantic memory.
Episodic memory stores our life events and ___________.|experiences|It is a time-related memory, and is very much autobiographical.  For example: Your 15th birthday, an event which happened at a specific time, would be an episodic memory.  On the other hand, you probably know the definition of justice, but you don't remember the time and place you learned the definition--it's a semantic memory, not an episodic one.
__________ is a long-term memory, and is responsible for storing knowledge of how our own memory systems work.|Metamemory|It essentially directs all long-term memory searches.
Category __________ is the recall one experiences through the process of grouping words together into categories even if they are presented in a random order.|clustering|Typically this categorization is done through conceptual processes. Categories are created under many topics. They can be age related, family/friend specific, and may even be related to the emotion that was evoked by similar experiences.
Recall is a measure of retrieval in which an individual is provided with the fewest possible ____ to aid retrieval.|cues|This process allows an individual to quickly pull information from a database stored in the memory. Example: If you have studied diligently for a test, you may find that your level of answer recall is high, and the information comes to you quickly.
A measure of retrieval in which an individual is required to identify material previously learned as being ________ is known as recognition.|familiar|Recognition is the remembrance process that aids in the association and comparison between old and new information.
__________ is a measure of memory in which one notes the improvement in performance when learning material for a second time.|Relearning|Relearning is a building upon of prior knowledge, and is used within educational settings to command a higher sense of memory recognition for important items.
A concept is a mental event used to represent a category or _____ of events or objects.|class|Concepts represent groups of things, classes, or categories, and not just individual cases.
Vygotsky was a Russian researcher that described how _____________ influences might mold and shape cognitive structures.|environmental|Lev Vygotsky believed at each stage of life people were generally prepared to respond to a particular environment and the people in it.
Vygotsky believed that as a human develops there is always a zone of ________ development.|proximal|The zone of proximal development refers to a person's potential for development.  For example, with the help of an adult, there is a certain upper level of problem solving a child can do.  As the child progresses and learns, the zone of proximal development is constantly changing, because what used to be at the upper limit is now his current level of development.
While children play, they learn to _________ with other children. This helps them learn acceptable behavior, assists in their development of social norms, and develops the cognitive and emotional aspects of a child.|socialize|Play is a very important learning device for children because they grow and gain information that is important about themselves and the world around them. Play time provides multiple experiences for development and problem-solving.
Erik Erikson defined a crisis at each stage of development.  During infancy, from birth to age 1, a child deals with the crisis of _____.|trust|Trust vs Mistrust is the crisis Erikson defined for an infant up to 1 year of age.  In the first year of life, infants depend on others for food, warmth, and affection, and therefore must be able to blindly trust the parents (or caregivers) for providing these things.
Erik Erikson defined Independence vs. _____ as the crisis during stage 2 of his theory.|Shame|From birth, infants may be able to display happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear, but it isn't until one or two years of age that they really develop a concept of shame.
The Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP) was a language arts program designed for underachieving native Hawaiian children.  It was developed to help children improve their reading skills, and it tried to use the children's native _______ as a basis for instructional practices.|culture|KEEP emphasized trying to instruct children in a way that works best for their cultural background.  For example, researchers learned that Hawaiian children typically turn for assistance to their peers and older siblings rather than to adults, so KEEP set up peer-learning centers in the classrooms which encouraged children to help one another with learning tasks.
Language is a large collection of arbitrary _______ that have significance for a language-using community that follow certain rules of combination.|symbols|The symbols that make up language are commonly referred to as words, and words are the expressions that relay information from one person to another. 
The smallest unit of sound in the spoken language is known as a _______.|phoneme|Phonemes themselves have no meaning, but when they are placed together in proper order, they result in meaningful utterances; also known as words. 
_________ is the study of the meaning of words and sentences.|Semantics|In general, the study of the relationship between words and meanings. 
A ________ is the smallest unit of meaning in a language.|morpheme|Morphemes are the smallest units of meaning in a language, phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language.  For example, a phoneme in English might be the uh sound, whereas a morpheme might be the word man or the -ed in talked.  A phoneme cannot be divided into smaller sounds, and a morpheme cannot be divided into smaller meaningful units. 
In ______, units larger than morphemes, such as phrases and sentences, are isolated in manner that reflects a hierarchical structure.|syntax|Syntax refers to the rules whereby words or other elements of sentence structure are combined to form grammatical sentences.  For example, i stupid he is said, is not proper syntax for forming a sentence.  You would say i said he is stupid.
A common method for measuring syntactic development in a child is the ___.|MLU|MLU stands for Mean Length of Utterance.  The MLU of what a child says is determined by the number of meaningful units, or morphemes in his utterance. 
____________, or the beginning of sound making, develops within infants as they mimic their care takers words and expressions.|Vocalization|Vocalization is the utterance of noises and sounds that will later develop into meaningful words and phrases to other people within the child’s language and culture.
The development of a child’s language can be impacted by his environment, which includes the ______ regularly speaking and interacting with him.|people|
The one-word stage is a universal one in which language development within children is limited to ______ words.|single|It is typical during this stage to hear children say words like Mama, Dada, Dog, and other one and two syllable words. 
Naming is the development in early childhood in which a child begins ________ out objects and calling them by name.|pointing|This process appears to be a form of rote memorization where a child repeatedly names and indicates a specific object and typically will wait for validation if the object is correctly named.
Children speak their first word at about ten to ________ months of age.|thirteen|Most developmental psychologists agree that children speak their first word at about ten to thirteen months of age.
The term “fast mapping” was coined by psychologist Susan _____ and it refers to the way in which children quickly form an idea of the meaning of an unfamiliar word when they hear it in a familiar social context.|Carey|In a 1978 study by Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett, children learned a new word simply by hearing it contrasted with a familiar word.  They called this fast mapping and it has been observed in children as young as 15 months old.
The babbling stage is one of the first for infants in the development of language. It is during this stage that they begin to make sounds and utterances, but the sounds have no _______ within their care taker’s language.|meaning|During babbling, babies will often gurgle and coo, attempting to imitate the words and sounds that they hear around them. It is critical that care takers speak to children and interact with them to ensure healthy speech development within young children.
_________ is a substage which occurs at the beginning of the babbling stage when infants enlarge their repertoire to include more phonemes (distinctive sounds) than they will eventually come to use.|Expansion|This period of expansion includes all the noises and sounds that babies make during infancy, but realize as they grow and begin to develop words that there is no need for the use of many of their sounds once they learn meaningful words. In other words, there is no need for a child to grunt and point at a glass if they have already learned to say Wa-wa or Water.
At the end of the babbling stage, infants narrow their use of phonemes mainly to the ones that they will be using in the language they will eventually acquire. This is known as _______ contraction.|phoneme|This is the stage when children lose the babbling and cooing, and develop sounds more similar to their care taker's words and phrases. This stage indicates the beginning of language development in linguistics. 
Phoneme _________ is the perceptual ability that develops in infancy in which a phoneme, although spoken or pronounced differently by different individuals, is perceived as a single entity regardless of the speech.|constancy|It is through the practice of mimicry, that young children learn how to sound out or pronounce words and phrases. 
A child's first words are holophrases--a single word conveys different meanings depending on the _______ in which it is used.|context|For example, the utterance mama is a good example of a holophrase.  In one instance it may communicate I want a cookie, and in another Let me out of the playpen. 
The most common semantic ________ which children make when they are learning to speak are underextension and overextension.|mistakes|Underextension and overextension are the two most common semantic errors when children are learning to speak.  Underextension is where a word is applied to a smaller number of objects and events than is appropriate--i.e. 'dog' refers only to the house pet.  Overextension is the opposite--i.e. 'daddy' refers to any adult man.
___________ is the study of the nature, structure, and variation of language, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, sociolinguistics, and pragmatics.|Linguistics|Linguists are the researchers that study all aspects of language, speech, sounds, and all other human utterances. This study includes words, phrases, babbling, cooing, small segments of words, word meaning, and other relative relationships.
Chomsky suggests teaching children language through the process of ______ barrage.|verbal|Noam Chomsky believed that it is acceptable to use words with a child that are beyond the child’s current level of comprehension. He believed that this developed children more rapidly with language, meaning, and abstraction. To share more complex words teaches them more possible meanings in words and word phrases.
The _____________ period is the very beginning stage of language development. It is within this stage that newborns will learn their language in a step-by-step fashion.|prelinguistic|Prelinguistics is the period of language learning before a child actually learns to speak. During this period children learn to gurgle, coo, and babble. 
A holophrase is a possible ________ statement made by children in the one-word stage when they utter single words.|semantic|These holophrases may be single word utterances, but can still contain a large amount of meaning allowing a child to communicate with older, more sophisticated communicators.
Duos is a linguistic term used to describe the ___-word utterances made by children during the two-word stage.|two|Children during this two-word stage are better able to express their needs and desires with word combinations than when they only had one–word phrases. 
A pattern of speech that develops following and including the two-word stage, in which English-speaking children rely on a grammar of strict word order to convey their meaning and do not use ____________, prepositions, or other function words is known as telegraphic speech.|conjunctions|This kind of speech is used by young children to express meaning through word combinations and phrases, but does not adhere to strict grammatical rules. Example: A child might say I want ball bubbles stickers. They may use this sort of pattern rather than separating each noun with the connector 'and'. 
Grammatical _________ are words or parts of words that help add meaning to a sentence and that are acquired by children generally between the ages of 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> and 5 years. Conjunctions, prepositions, or other function words indicate these kinds of morphemes.|morphemes|It is the use of grammatical morphemes, word usage and arrangement that indicate language development and sophistication. Example: I would like to have the ball, the bubbles, and the stickers, please! 
Observational learning occurs when a person's behavior changes after _______ the behavior of someone else.|viewing|Observational learning is changing your behavior based on something you've seen someone else do.  Many people say that children learn through observational learning when they watch TV and imitate the violence they see.
Elaboration is a way to better remember new information--it involves making ____________ between the new information and what you already know.|associations|Elaboration involves connecting new information to the information we already have--associating a new, unfamiliar concept with a familiar one.
__________ is the ability to originate something new and appropriate by transcending common thought constraints and to create something the value of which becomes more apparent over time.|Creativity|Creative thinking is often associated with artistic endeavors such as composing music, art, or writing poetry. However, the definition indicates that one can think of any subject in a creative way just by providing a new and original idea, or seeing a problem from a new perspective.
____________ intelligence provides the abilities that depend on acquired knowledge, accumulated experience, and general information to include the sorts of skills that remain quite constant or even increase throughout one’s lifetime.|Crystallized|Crystallization is the accumulation of strategies, knowledge, learning, and information that one has learned throughout life. It remains quite constant or even increases.  Example: Crystallized learning can apply to the child taking piano lessons at age six and playing masterfully at age 60.
A load is the weight or emphasis given to any factor or ability applicable to ____________.|intelligence|This means that more emphasis is typically placed in some areas of intelligence and learning than in other areas. For example, it may be more important for school teachers to push the concepts of grammar and abstraction rather than the ability to speak French.
________ can play a role in determining the level of intelligence a person is capable of achieving.|Genetics|However, genetics are certainly not the only factor in intelligence. Things such as culture, experience, and health are all factors in the development of intellectual ability.
Studies have shown correlations between achievement and birth order.  firstborn children tend to be more ________ and more achievement oriented.|creative|The way they were raised tends to make firstborn children more achievement oriented as well as having a higher degree of responsibility.  They also tend to have higher self-esteem than later born children.
___________ tests are those that purport to measure acquired knowledge rather than potential or aptitude.|Achievement|Achievement tests determine what knowledge a person has already learned. It does not take into consideration the unused potential a person may have to learn.
_______-fair tests are supposedly free of cultural biases; and are usually constructed so that language differences, as well as other cultural effects are minimized.|Culture|A culture-fair test may be constructed to allow a Spanish speaking student the same chances to score well as an English speaking student would have if given in a school within the U.S.
An __ test is one that attempts to gather the knowledge of a person given their academic exposure and age.|IQ|IQ (Intelligence Quotient) testing provides a sort of map for people to determine the ability for one to learn information. These tests, in many cases, are seen as biased for a number of reasons including the social and economic status of an individual during his upbringing.
Birth-_____ data will show that firstborn children tend to be more successful than other children born later.|order|
____________ is a general term for a person’s abilities in a wide range of tasks including vocabulary, numbers, problem solving, and concepts. It may also include the ability to profit from experience, to learn new information, and to adjust to new situations.|Intelligence|Intelligence usually indicates the knowledge obtained by a person, and their ability to learn from experience.
Gender ________ is a basic sense of self-awareness of one’s own maleness or femaleness.|identity|
Attitudes and expectations about how a person should act, think, or feel solely on the basis of being male or female form what are known as ______ roles.|gender|
An ___________ person possesses a combination of traits that are both masculine and feminine.|androgynous|
The social behaviors of people show significant differences between the two genders. The areas with the biggest differences are: __________ and communication.|aggression|Men are found to be much more aggressive than females, and the research indicates that this begins in preschool and continues into late adulthood. Regarding communication, women appear to be much more intuitive in terms of effective communication, and seek the opportunity to express themselves verbally much more than men during research.
A strong, two-way, emotional/social relationship, usually between a child and its ______ or caregiver is known as an attachment.|mother|This connotes a juvenile need for a person that represents safety.
Ainsworth identified three categories of __________ based on infant-caregiver relationships.|attachment|Mary Ainsworth’s three attachment categories are: secure, anxious-ambivalent and avoidant.
According to Mary Ainsworth, infants who seem ___________ when the caregiver leaves the room and avoid contact when the caregiver returns are avoidant.|unconcerned|Avoidant is one of two insecure attachment categories, anxious-ambivalent is the other.
A child who clings to their parent to prevent the parent from leaving is demonstrating _______-ambivalent attachment characteristics.|anxious|An anxious-ambivalent child will often seem more upset when the parent returns than when the parent left.
Infants who are ________ attached to their caretakers are more confident, enthusiastic, persistent, cooperative, and in general more effective beings by the time they reach two years of age.|securely|Insecurely attached infants, on the other hand, tend to have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, are dependent and do not make friends readily.
The most common form of attachment is known as ______ attachment.|secure|Securely attached children respond happily to their mother’s return, greet her, and stay near her for awhile.
British psychiatrist John ______ was a pioneer in attachment theory.  |Bowlby|Bowlby believed that if a child's bonding with his mother was somehow disrupted, it would result in a host of undesirable consequences including depression, mourning, the inability to love, etc.  Bowlby's theories have formed the foundation for today's attachment theories.
The three ______ of parenting are Authoritative, Authoritarian, and Permissive.|styles|These are the three general styles of parenting according to Diana Baumrind's theory of parenting styles.
Authoritarian parents enforce rigid rules and demand strict _________.|obedience|Children of authoritarian parents, are expected to obey without question, have few rights and adult-like responsibilities. 
Authoritative parents supply firm and consistent guidance, combined with love and _________.|affection|They control their children in a non-authoritarian, caring way and give reasons to children for their rules.
Parents who adopt the permissive style of parenting have few _____ and do not consistently enforce discipline.  This style of parenting is often called anything goes”.|rules|Parenting styles fall into one of three main categories: authoritarian, authoritative and permissive.  Parents who impose few rules, engage in endless negotiations, emphasize individuality and possess a belief that all opinions are equal are operating with a permissive parenting style.
There are three main disciplinary styles used by parents.  Research shows that acceptance of the child and unconditional affection, coupled with an _________ style of discipline results in a well adjusted, confident child.|induction|Children who grow up with parents using a power assertion style of discipline tend to be more aggressive in their behavior.  On the other hand, induction, in which the parent explains to the child the reasons for not doing something, results in well-adjusted, confident children.  Example of induction: If you stand on the ball you could fall and hit your head. That is why I don’t want you to stand on the ball. I don’t want you to fall off and get hurt.
Albert Bandura’s approach to learning is also cognitive in nature, but his added a decidedly social aspect to the process and for that reason is often referred to as the ______ theory.|social|The central idea of Bandura's theory is that learning takes place through the observation and the imitation of models. What makes social learning theory social is the notion that we often learn from others.
Bandura's social cognitive theory emphasized both the social origins of thoughts and actions as well as the human capacity for self __________.|regulation|Bandura indicated that we observe both the actions of others as well as the consequences of those actions.  And that based on those observations we form rules of behavior for specific situations which we then apply to regulate our own actions.
In his social cognitive theory, Bandura emphasized the importance of ____-direction and motivation.|self|Bandura believed it was important for students to take responsibility for their own learning.
Lewis Terman's study of highly intelligent children showed that ______ children grow up to become gifted adults, and that they tend to be  successful, well-adjusted, and long-lived.... healthier, wealthier, and wiser.|gifted|Gifted, or highly intelligent children tend to grow up to become well-adjusted adults.
Social cognition is the application of cognitive principles to the ______ arena.|social|This essentially means that a person uses the information that he has learned in his life about appropriateness, cultural norms and expectations and applies them when dealing with people in a social situation.
Prosocial behaviors are those that are moral and _______ other people, as well as society.|benefit|An example of prosocial behavior can be seen in the acts of people who volunteer to feed the homeless, care for an elderly person in need, or provide assistance to other people without expecting anything, such as money or gifts, in response to his actions.
Antisocial behavior is the tendency to be difficult with people, the display of selfish and uncaring qualities towards individuals and society, and only seeks to gain for one’s ____.|self|
______ are the attitudes and beliefs that people hold that help them to determine what is right or wrong.|Morals|These are ideas that are usually learned from role models in a person’s life. If a child has parents that care for other people in the community, donate money, and are willing to be of service to others, they tend to pass these positive qualities along to their children.
In Lawrence Kohlberg’s (1927-1987) work on morality, he determined that there are three levels of moral ___________.|development|Within each level there are two stages.
According to Kohlberg, a level of moral development in which good or bad is determined by the physical or hedonistic ____________ of obeying or disobeying the rules is known as the preconventional level.|consequences|At this level of moral development, the child is responsive to rules and evaluative labels, but views them in terms of pleasant or unpleasant consequences of actions, or in terms of the physical power of those who impose the rules.
The ____________ level, according to Kohlberg, is the second level of moral development.  In this level, the individual strives to maintain the expectations of family, group, or nation, regardless of the consequences.|conventional|In this level there is such a strong desire to find acceptance and respect from those around you that you will do anything to please others, even if the outcome is negative. Example: Young men who are willing to go to fight a war for their country may be terrified of injury and death, but it is more important for some of them to go and receive praise and approval from family and society.
Kohlberg’s ________________ level is the final level of moral development, one where moral development is characterized by self-chosen ethical principles that are comprehensive, universal, and consistent.|postconventional|An example of this may be seen in the actions of King Arthur who was known as a valiant and noble king. He strove to maintain respect, morality, and dignity at all costs.  The three main stages of moral development according to Kohlberg are Preconventional / Premoral, Conventional / Role Conformity, and Postconventional / Self-accepted Moral Principles.
According to Kohlberg's Moral Stages of Development, the most immature kind of person refrains from doing something wrong to avoid __________.|punishment|According to Kohlberg's theory, a person at the lowest level of moral development decides whether he will perform an action in terms of pleasant or unpleasant consequences of those actions, or in terms of the physical power of those who impose the rules.  Later, in level 2, a more morally mature person bases his decisions on getting other people's approval, or in level 3, out of a sense of right and wrong and his own conscience.
Empathy is the insightful awareness and ability to _____ emotions, thoughts, and behaviors of another person.|share|Empathy is a part of peer socialization and development, which is critical in the development of meaningful relationships. It allows a person to be understanding and kind to others, and helps one person relate to another’s feelings, thoughts, and actions.
__________ behavior is behavior that benefits someone else, with little or no apparent benefit for the actor.|Altruistic|Altruists are people who display generous and moral acts, and have learned through peer socialization the importance of caring for other people without expectation of reward in return.
____ groups are groups who develop their own set of values and goals and establish durable social relationships. Generally, each member has a specified role or status.|Peer|Peer groups are groups that are generally all of the same age range, and allow people to find appropriate behaviors and actions based on cultural norms.

Parents who abuse their children often have ____ expectations for their children, or the abuse may be stress related.|high|The abuse may be stress related, or as a result of high expectations of the child by the parent.  There are other reasons, but these are two of the most common.
Child neglect is the _______ by parents, caregivers, or other people responsible for children’s welfare to provide reasonable and prudent standards of care for children in their charge, which thereby threatens the child’s well-being.|failure|Neglect can range from improper nutrition and bathing to lack of supervision which can harm or kill a child.
When looking for a good day care center, one of the main things to look for is a high _______ to child ratio.|teacher|A high teacher or caregiver to child ratio is a key thing to look for in a good day care center.  In other words, you don't want 50 kids per adult.
_____ assertion is a disciplinary technique in which caregivers use physical punishment, removal of privileges, or the threat of these actions.|Power|If you don’t stop climbing on the furniture, you can’t watch any television today.
Love withdrawal is a ____________ technique in which caregivers express disapproval by ignoring, isolating, or expressing a lack of love for the child.|disciplinary|This action is often viewed in current times as emotional abuse or manipulation. The removal of love and attention from a child can be detrimental to their development.
Induction is a disciplinary technique in which caregivers try to show the child _________ behind the principle.|reasoning|This is an approach where the parent attempts to use the child’s logic and intellect to understand the disciplinary action. Example: If you stand on the ball you could fall and hit your head. That is why I don’t want you to stand on the ball. I don’t want you to fall off and get hurt.
___________ families are those that have both a mother and a father, and children all residing in the same house.|Traditional|Traditional families often have traditional roles where the father functions as the authoritative figure.
When _______ occurs, the parents separate and often split the children between the two homes that each parent resides in.|divorce|Divorce is the permanent separation of the husband and wife, which can result in problems with the children. Children often feel pulled between the two parents, and sometimes parents talk negatively about the other parent to the children leading to hurt and confusion for the children involved.
Extended family is one that has parents, ____________, and children living together.|grandparents|This was common until around the turn of the century in the United States. Typically, the grandparents provided extra support and care for the children, and lent a feeling of unity.
A nuclear family is defined as one that consists of parents and children ____ residing in the same household.|only|Nuclear families began in some respects after industrialization when people moved away from their extended families to seek employment in other areas.
__________ gaps often exist within families and are known to create conflict as a result of the differences in social and political values held by members of different generations.|Generation|Example: A grandfather may believe that girls should not go out on a date until they are eighteen, but a sixteen year old girl may believe it is fine to begin dating at a younger age like many of her friends.
The _____-nest syndrome occurs when parents find that their children have all grown and moved out of their house. The need to nurture and focus on their children can lead to depression and a sense of loss after many years of providing as a caretaker.|empty|
___________ is the mutual exchange of privileges and is critical to the smooth operation of any relationship, especially within families.|Reciprocity|
Sibling _______ can occur between brothers and sisters and develops out of a sense of jealousy and agitation that exist during the maturation process.|rivalry|Sibling rivalry is a common occurrence in families between young children, as well as teenagers. Some people never outgrow this tendency to fight and argue with their siblings, and the rivalry has even known to spark bouts of serious violence between siblings.
_____ (1632-1704) was an Englishman who brought philosophy to the threshold of psychology.|Locke|John Locke was an English philosopher, founder of British empiricism.  At that time, the field of psychology did not exist yet, but John Locke was a key figure who brought philosophy closer to the actual science of psychology.
British __________ focused on the content of the mind and claimed that it is acquired through experience.|empiricism|Locke and other empiricists believed that we are each born into this world with our minds empty, essentially like blank slates.  In other words, they believed that we aren't born with preprogrammed beliefs or behavioral tendencies--we learn everything from our environment after we are born.
_____ was the founder of psychoanalytic theory, which he derived from observations of many patients.|Freud|Sigmund Freud studied the development of people’s personality, and he did this through the use of techniques he had developed to probe the hidden thoughts in the unconscious.
Freud believed that too much or too little ___________ during any stage could result in a fixation, leaving the person immature or incomplete in certain areas of development.|stimulation|He argued that many adult personality problems could be traced back to early fixations.
Of the five stages listed in Freud’s ____________ stages, the first three dealt with physical satisfaction which centered around the erogenous zones, while the last two dealt with latency (of sexuality) and then in adulthood the Genital Stage (Puberty to Adulthood).|psychosexual|Freud’s psychosexual theory listed the first three stages as the oral stage, the anal stage, and the phallic stage. The last two stages were the latency and genital, which span from puberty into adulthood.
It is during the oral stage (from birth to approximately 1 year of age) that Freud believed a child’s greatest satisfaction came from the stimulation of the lips, _____, tongue, and gums. He noted that sucking and chewing are the chief sources of an infant’s pleasure.|mouth|In the Oral Stage, infants and some toddlers have a tendency to use their sense of taste, as well as oral stimulation, as a means of pacification, relaxation, and pleasure. This may mean using a pacifier, chewing on fingers, and even biting other people.
From roughly one to three years of age, Freud stated that this ____ stage (roughly 1-3 years of age) provided children with the most satisfaction by exercising his/her own control over the anus during elimination and retention.|anal|In this stage, he viewed children withholding bathroom trips as an exertion of power by the child. He believed also that this stage reached its peak once toilet training was successfully completed.
According to Freud, the _______ stage (4-6 years of age) was the time that children gained the most satisfaction from stimulating their genitals.|phallic|Freud noticed an increase in the tendency for children to recognize and handle their genitals more regularly. He also viewed this time as the identification period with the child’s same-sex parent. This relationship with the same-sex parent, in Freud’s theory, allows children to become healthy, mature adults.
Titchener was responsible for the refinement of _____________.|introspection|This is a method for studying consciousness first used in Wundt’s laboratory. Introspection literally means to look within. A person who is introspective thinks about their thoughts, feelings, and actions, and considers his place in the world to determine if changes are necessary.
Freud believed that the process of socialization is a matter of society controlling the __.|Id|Freud saw the personality as being composed of three parts--the id, ego, and superego.  The id is the most basic part of our personality--the pleasure seeking, primitive biological force which we must suppress and find realistic ways to satisfy.
According to Freud, the ___ is governed by the reality principle, while the superego is dominated by the morality principle.|ego|The id is governed by the pleasure principle, the ego by the reality principle, and the superego by the morality principle.  The id seeks to immediately satisfy its desires with any means available, the ego recognizes that it cannot immediately satisfy all of its desires because of real-world constraints, and the superego is a reflection of social constraints--a child's internalization of the parents' value systems.
Binet (1857-1911), was a French psychologist who is known for his research and innovation in _______ human intelligence.|testing|Binet, along with Théodore Simon, devised a series of tests that, with revisions, came into wide use in schools, industries, and the army.
_________ suggests that we view intelligence theories in terms of the metaphors on which they are based: geographic, computational, biological, epistemological, anthropological, sociological, and systems. |Sternberg|According to Sternberg, theories of intelligence should be applied with the metaphors that relate to the subject in question.
____ was created to evaluate the components of Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of successful intelligence.|STAT|Sternberg’s theory includes three components: analytical, creative and practical.  The Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test (STAT) includes analytical questions to measure the ability to learn from context and reason; creative questions to assess the ability to cope with new situations; and practical questions to assess the ability to solve everyday problems.
Clinical psychology includes those psychologists whose concern is with the psychological well-being of the __________.|individual|The training and experience of clinicians provide them with the means to diagnose and treat individuals with psychological disorders.
In the latent stage (Approximately 6 years to Puberty) Freud found that the sexual drive of an individual becomes _______ until puberty.|dormant|Freud also indicates that during this time children are free of erotic feelings, and spend most of their time developing social and cultural skills.
In the _______ stage (Puberty to Adulthood) Feud believed that heterosexual desire awakens.|genital|He also believed that if the early experiences were free from upset or fixations, then the individual was on his/her way to a healthy and normal adult life.
As a student under Sigmund Freud for many years, _______ expanded upon Freud’s psychoanalytic ideas, and developed his own views on human development as a progression through eight psychosocial stages.|Erikson|Erik Erikson stated that at each of the eight psychosocial stages, a person is faced with conflicts that he or she must resolve to fully develop as a person. His psychosocial stages do differ from Freud’s stages in three key areas. First, Erikson places a much greater emphasis on social and cultural forces than Freud’s theories. Second, Erikson does not believe that a failure at any one stage will cause irreversible damage to that individual. And the third, Erikson emphasizes the entire lifespan of an individual.
_________, complex patterns of behavior that occur in the presence of particular stimuli are known as instincts.|Unlearned|
A ____ is a lack or shortage of some biological essential resulting from deprivation.|need|The key thing to note is that a need refers to something biologically needed, not something your mind thinks it needs or craves.
A state of _______ resulting from a need that arouses and directs an organism’s behavior is known as a drive.|tension|A drive is a state of activation that occurs as a response to a need or desire for something.
If a child grows out of sucking his thumb, but then after a _________ experience goes back to sucking his thumb all the time, that is an example of regression.|traumatic|Regression is defined as a reversion to an earlier or less mature pattern of feeling or behavior.  If a child goes back to sucking his thumb, or starts wetting the bed regularly even though he is potty-trained, that is regression.
Maslow is associated with the ________ movement in psychology. He combined his concerns for the person with Hull’s drive-reduction theory and proposed that human behavior does in fact respond to needs, yet not all are physiological needs.|humanism|Abraham Maslow defined the Hierarchy of Needs, in which the needs at the bottom must be fulfilled before the needs at the top become a source of motivation.  From the bottom up, the hierarchy consists of physiological, safety, love, esteem, and finally self-actualization needs.
External stimuli that an organism may be motivated to approach or avoid are known as __________.|incentives|Incentives are consequences that trigger feelings that are positive or negative, and often dictate future behavior.
One of the first references to a need to maintain a balanced state is found in the work of Walter Cannon. Cannon was concerned with our internal physiological reactions, and the term he used to describe a state of balance or ___________ within those reactions is homeostasis.|equilibrium|It is a state of balance among internal, physiological conditions.
Cognitive __________ is a motivating discomfort or tension caused by a lack of balance or consonance among one’s cognitions.|dissonance|For example, a cult believes that the earth is going to be destroyed by a flood, and its members give up their homes and jobs to work for the cult, but the flood does not happen.  At that point, the cult members are probably experiencing cognitive dissonance--between one cognition of expecting a flood, and one cognition of the flood not having occurred.
Another approach to motivation that relies on the notion of balance and equilibrium is called the ________-process theory.|opponent|The basic idea here is that one’s emotional reactions to affect-arousing stimuli naturally produce opposite emotional reactions in order to maintain a balanced level of affect or emotion.
Research shows that in nursing homes, helping the elderly to maintain a sense of control can have a positive effect on them psychologically and in sustaining ____.|life|Once in a nursing home, the elderly typically suffer from depression, feelings of helplessness, and accelerated decline; much of that comes from the loss of control they feel that they have over their lives.  It is important that the elderly not be deprived of the opportunity to make decisions and choices for themselves.
The hypothalamus is a small brain structure involved in many drives, including thirst, hunger, sex, and ___________ regulation.|temperature|
Internal, physiological cues are signals from the (inside) physiological aspect of an individual that indicate something is desired as a result of a ________ need.|physical|The desire for food is a physical need that is signaled from our bodies, and is an internal instinct.
________, psychological cues are triggered when a person desires a thing that is not driven at a biological level. There is no physical need for such a desire, yet the person still craves the thing psychologically.|External|Example: The desire for a person to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol are both external desires.
Intrinsic control is an ________, personal process that controls or motivates an individual’s behavior.|internal|
An emotion is a reaction involving subjective feelings, _____________ response, cognitive interpretation, and behavioral expression.|physiological|
________ is demonstrated by a relatively permanent change in behavior that occurs as the result of practice or experience.|Learning|
____________ and learning are synonymous terms and can be used interchangeably.|Conditioning|Conditioning is known as the most basic and fundamental type of learning.  It occurs when a person is repeatedly challenged with a task or situation to which he eventually learns to respond with the best outcome. Example: If you are learning to drive a car and brake quickly you will be jarred. After a few times of braking and feeling the jarring sensation, you will learn to brake more slowly. Conditioning is often based on cause and effect.
Psychology was just beginning to emerge as a science late in the nineteenth century. At this time, Pavlov was using his skills as a physiologist to try to understand the basic processes of digestion.  In his research he discovered a basic principle of conditioning known as a ______.|reflex|Ivan Pavlov is known for his experiments in classical conditioning with a dog.  He would ring a bell every time he gave the dog food.  Eventually, the dog became conditioned to salivate every time he heard the bell, even if there was no food.
A ______ is defined as an unlearned, automatic response that occurs in the presence of specific stimuli.|reflex|These are mental and physical reactions to the environment around a person.  In Pavlov's experiment, the reflex being studied was salivation.  Dogs salivate when they see food--it's a reflex because they don't have to think about salivating, it automatically happens as a response to the stimulus of food.
______’s study is now known as classical conditioning.|Pavlov|This is a type of learning in which an originally neutral stimulus comes to evoke a new response after having been paired with another stimulus that reflexively evokes the same response.
An unconditioned stimulus is a stimulus that produces a response, even in the absence of ____________.|conditioning|An example is the unconditional stimulus of food in the classic studies of Ivan Pavlov, which always produces the unconditional response of salivation.
To get classical conditioning under way, a second stimulus, which is neutral, must be presented, and produces a minimal response or a response of no particular interest.  This stimulus is known as the ___________ stimulus.|conditioned|This process is technically referred to as habituation.  A conditioned stimulus is one that normally is not associated with a reaction.  In Pavlov's experiment, the bell was a conditioned stimulus for salivating--normally a dog does not salivate in response to a bell, it had to be conditioned to do so.
A conditioned ________ is the recurring result of action that indicates a behavior is learned or conditioned.|response|A conditioned response is a learned response--it does not naturally happen.  In Pavlov's experiment, salivating was a conditioned response to a bell ringing.  On the other hand, salivating was an unconditioned response to the presence of food.
_______ used the term operant to refer to behavior that an organism may use to operate on its environment.|Skinner|Operants are said to be controlled by their consequences-they will maintain or increase their rate if they are reinforced; they will decrease their rate if they are not reinforced or if they are punished.
_______ involves reinforcing successive approximations of the response that one ultimately wants to condition.|Shaping|Basically, shaping involves first reinforcing a behavior only vaguely similar to the one desired.  Once that is established, you look out for variations that come a little closer to what you want, and so on, until you have the animal performing a behavior that would never show up in ordinary life.
Harlow discovered the ________ set, a kind of learning to learn, a process whereby animals learn to solve new problems very quickly.|learning|A learning set is a tendency to approach a problem in a certain way as a result of previous experience with similar problems.  The term was introduced by Harry Harlow to characterize the remarkable improvements he observed in monkeys’ performance on discrimination problems as a result of their being given hundreds of problems of the same type.
______ learning is a hidden learning that is not demonstrated in performance until that performance is reinforced.|Latent|Latent is the potential for learning or behavior that exists within a person, but has not yet been used. Example: A girl may have a beautiful singing voice, but does not sing enough to know that she is capable of it.
_________ reinforcement is the increased rate (of reinforcement) or decreasing rate of (punishment) of responses due to observing the consequences of someone else’s behavior.|Vicarious|Thus, it is more likely for an individual to model or imitate the behavior of a person who is rewarded or praised, rather than follow the pattern of one who is punished for his/her behavior.
A punisher is a stimulus that _________ the rate or probability of a response that precedes it.|decreases|
In operant conditioning, ______________ occurs when a response reinforced in the presence of one stimulus also occurs in the presence of another, similar stimulus.|generalization|Therefore, the person responds equally to both stimuli, as he/she recognizes a close relationship between the two stimuli.
An Instinctive drift is the term used by the Brelands to note that some behaviors are more difficult to _________ than others.|condition|That is, in spite of conditioning efforts, an organism will drift toward doing something that comes naturally.
A ________ reinforcer is a stimulus presented to an organism that increases the rate of a response that precedes it.|positive|Positive reinforcers are similar to rewards.  A positive reinforcer would be something positive, that a person receives for showing an appropriate response.  For example, giving a child a cookie for getting an A on her pop quiz.
A negative reinforcer is a stimulus that increases the rate of response that precedes its _______.|removal|Although it seems a bit contradictory, a negative reinforcer exists to increase the rate of responses to action.  A negative reinforcer would involve removing something negative in exchange for the desired behavior.  For example, a seat belt buzzer not going off until you buckle your seat belt is a negative reinforcer--the seat belt buzzer turns off once you show the desired behavior.
Escape conditioning is a part of operant conditioning and demonstrates ________ reinforcement.|negative|Here, an organism learns to escape from a painful situation. If an appropriate response is made for the situation and the escape is successful, the organism is reinforced and will tend to make the same response again in the future with a similar situation.
Another ________ reinforcement in action is avoidance conditioning. Here, an organism learns to avoid unpleasant and painful situations before it occurs.|negative|The major difference between avoidance and escape conditioning is the addition of a cue or signal that precedes the negative reinforcer. Responding appropriately to the signal allows the organism to prevent the painful, unpleasant situation before it occurs. Example: If a person has been embarrassed in a large social situation, she may choose not to attend large gatherings and parties to avoid possible embarrassment again.
_______ reinforcers are stimuli (usually biological or physiological) that increase the rate of a response with no previous experience required.|Primary|Primary reinforcer directly reinforces--it would be something like food.  This is in contrast to a secondary reinforcer, which would be something like a token which can be exchanged for rewards.  The token itself is not really the reinforcer, it's what the token can get you that causes it to have a reinforcing effect.
A _________ reinforcer contains stimuli that increase the rate of a response because of it's association with other reinforcers; also called conditioned, or learned, reinforcers.|secondary|Ice cream could be a primary reinforcer, a token which can be exchanged for a toy, or ice cream, would be a secondary reinforcer.  The secondary reinforcer itself isn't something you would necessary want, it's what it is associated with that reinforces your response.
A continuous reinforcement schedule is a reinforcement schedule in which each and every ________ is followed by a reinforcer.|response|One problem with the CRF schedule is that earning a reinforcer after each response may soon reduce the reinforcing nature of that reinforcer.  This is in contrast to an intermittent reinforcement schedule, where a reinforcer is provided after some correct responses, not all.  An example of a continuous reinforcement schedule is when every time a student brings home straight A's, his parents give him money.
Once a conditioned response has been established, if it is not reinforced again, after a period of time, it is ____________.|extinguished|Once a response is conditioned, it is not permanent.  It needs to be reinforced from time to time, or it is extinguished.  For example, in Pavlov's experiment, if he continues to ring the bell, but food never accompanies the bell, then eventually the dogs will stop salivating in response to the bell.
Many schools use 504 plans to assist students who have physical ____________.|disabilities|A 504 plan is a legal contract between the teacher, administrator, and parent that will indicate special assistance for and the clearly defined limitations of a student.
An ___ is a legal plan for students that list accommodations needed by a student with behavioral or cognitive delays that must be addressed within the classroom to assist the student in succeeding.|IEP|IEP (Independent Educational Program). IEP’s may indicate the need for a dictionary, calculator, note-taking assistance, and other special accommodations.
_______ focused chiefly on psychosocial development; in contrast, Freud focused chiefly on psychosexual development.|Erikson|Erik Erikson and Sigmund Freud both defined stages of development.  However, the major difference between the two theories is that Erikson's stages covers across the entire lifespan into old age, while Freud's theory ends with adolescence.
A classroom that has mainstream students as well as students with _______ physical, mental, emotional, or cognitive challenges is known as an inclusion class.|special|The inclusion process is mandatory in all public schools under federal law and indicates that students of varied backgrounds may all be placed in one learning environment to assist in the moral, academic, and social development of all students. Usually there are two teachers within the inclusion classroom; a subject matter teacher and a special education teacher. The two teachers work to collaborate on lesson plans and testing to create a fair and balanced academic environment for all students.
It is generally the aim of all schools to educate their students and prepare them for future academic and professional successes. Teachers try to educate students comprehensively to ensure a smooth __________ into adulthood and the responsibilities and challenges that they will face.|transition|
A person with an external locus of control typically attributes _______ to things beyond his control.|failure|A student with an external locus of control might blame his teacher's teaching style, or his parent's lack of support as a reason for failing a test.  On the other hand, a student with an internal locus of control might blame himself, believing that his performance at school is tied to how much effort he puts into it.
There are many kinds of childcare in the U.S. There are learning center, daycare centers, home schooling, and __________ schools, which aim to develop student’s natural talents through an open classroom environment that does not restrict students to age groups or special classrooms.|Montessori|Maria Montessori was the first female physician in Italy, and made child development and education her most notable cause.
Within all learning environments, especially special needs, scaffolding is used as a _________ support for a student mastering a new task.|temporary|This is a system of close support and guidance used to give a sense of security and immediate reference to students while they learn new subjects. Example: A chemistry teacher may stand next to students mixing chemicals for the first few times to ensure they mix them correctly, and provide them with immediate feedback on their labs.
In children with autism, _________ occurs with greater frequency and lasts for a longer period of time than normal, healthy children.|echolalia|According to one study, up to 75% of people with autism exhibit echolalia in some form.  Echolalia is the imitative repetition or echoing of sounds or words just spoken by another person.  It is commonly referred to as parroting.
Care for older people, or eldercare, is offered as a source of physical and emotional support. As people age, they often have a need for supervision or assistance. The field of studying and caring for the elderly is known as __________.|geriatrics|
Age related hearing loss, ___________, remains the most common sensory deficit in the older population.|presbycusis|Hearing declines with age.  Presbycusis happens to both men and women, but older men are especially likely to experience it.
Cataracts are one of the most common causes of ______ loss among the elderly.|vision|The presence of cataracts, or a decrease in the transparency of the lens in the eye, is fairly common among older adults (75 and older).
Interventions are planned meetings where people can meet with ___________ about another person to help that individual with emotional, behavioral, or chemical dependency concerns.|specialists|Many places offer intervention assistance: churches, synagogues, psychiatric institutes, and qualified therapists and counselors.
Ideas or thoughts that involuntarily and persistently intrude into awareness are known as __________.|obsessions|Obsessions are fixations that people can develop over anything. A teenage girl may become obsessed with her boyfriend and follow him home from school each day. 
___________ are constantly intruding, stereotyped, and essentially involuntary acts or behaviors.|Compulsions|A person may become compulsive about cleanliness and clean their bodies, homes, and belongings repeatedly. 
Psychological disorders that reflect imagined physical or bodily symptoms or complaints are known as __________ disorders.|somatoform|What makes these psychological or mental disorders somatoform is that in each case, there is no known medical or biological cause for the symptoms. 
_____________ disorders are disorders with actual physical symptoms thought to be caused by psychological factors such as stress.|Psychosomatic|These are quite common, and can result in an array of illnesses from rashes to ulcers. Essentially what occurs is the person develops an illness as a result of psychological traumas and upsets. Example: A person suffering from stress and anxiety may experience headaches and nausea. 
A mental disorder involving the ____ of developing some serious disease or illness is known as hypochondriasis.|fear|Hypochondriacs often imagine that they have been exposed to sicknesses, and will perceive themselves as ill or injured for no reason. A person who is a hypochondriac might suffer real physical pains, such as headaches, or an upset stomach, and believe that he has ebola, even though repeated visits to the doctor has proven that he has no disease or illness.
The __________ of emotional distress or unconscious conflict into a physical symptom. It is one of the general classes of Somatoform disorders and is known as conversion disorder.|conversion|
